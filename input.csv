"What my bipolar feels like.   I visualize my bipolar depression as a dark hole. The deepness varies depending on the depth of the depression. I imagine seeing light at the top, and being able to climb part of the way out only to slide back down to the bottom time after time. After a while, I get used to the darkness. I let it wrap itself around me and even crawl into my head. It becomes all I can see and feel. It feels like it becomes me, and starts acting for me.  My mania feels like a rollercoaster that's going off the tracks. Sometimes it's thrilling and everything seems fine and great, and other times everything seems out of control, and like I'm stuck speeding down a course to destruction. In both instances, I keep doing whatever I'm doing until it all catches up with me, and I'm confronted with the reality of my situation and the consequences of my actions. When it ends, it ends with a bang. Life crumbles all around me, and the cycle back to depression begins.   Thankfully I've been learning about how to cope with it all, and with hard work and medication, I can hopefully get to a place where I can keep myself leveled out so I can focus on living my life."
"Ok this is going to be hard to explain......I have 2 kids, 5 and 6 already. Wife recently left me mostly due to my issues and inability to communicate/hold a conversation. Yet 90% of the time I still have the kids struggling to pay bills in a 60hr/wk job. I am 35, have had issues my entire life with ADD/Depression/Severe social phobia and suspected of aspegers. Got with wife at 28 who was not only my first girlfriend but actually first friend I have had in my life. She was desperate and at the time I was drunk enough all the time to talk to her and things went from there. If she never happened I am absolutely sure I would still be living at my dads house to be forever alone, basically whole thing was a bizarre fluke.    So to the point....Son is in kindergarten but has been getting in trouble since he started. They are at the point where they want to suspend him for his behavior. He has a hard time listening is their biggest complaint but also rough houses too much. Today they finally left a message saying if I dont meet with them by Thursday he will be suspended. So I have to take the day off and feel like he will be suspended anyways they just wanted to say it to my face. They want me to fix his behavior but as someone who had the exact same issues as a child I just dont know how I guess. I feel like I am considered a shitty parent but I do try to make him happy by working in a job I hate going to everyday and wish I could just quit and live off disability or something which with my issues I probably could get but have no motivation to get it going. I guess I am kind of ranting but I just am at a loss on what I can do. If I get a free day off I have tried taking him to the Dr to see about ADD meds at least but they want me to schedule it for certain times which is not possible with my work. I just hate to see him going down the same path as I did with school and dont know how to change it...."
"From the outside, my life seems pretty great. I've got a pretty stable family life, a girlfriend who loves me, a small but close group of friends, a job I love and my health is good. I shouldn't have anything to complain about, should I?  Yet every single day, when I'm not at work, I just feel alone. My girlfriend lives a couple of hours away but we try to see each other for a week or two each month, that's become a lot harder since I started working more, especially over Christmas but we talk every day. I know I can always talk to my friends, I even work with my closest friend and we spend pretty much every day we're not working together. I just feel empty though, I feel like something is missing from my life and I don't know what it is.  Me and my girlfriend have been going through a few problems for a while now and I've found myself with increasing thoughts about breaking up with her. I love her, and I want to fix things, but one thing constantly plays on my mind. Do I want to stay with her because I love her, or do I want to stay with her because I'm terrified of being alone?  I don't know what to do. I always find myself sitting awake, alone, at 3, 4, maybe 5am every morning, craving just someone to talk to, someone who understands what I feel. Maybe I'm just being stupid, that's what it feels like. I don't even know what I hope to achieve with this post, maybe there's someone reading this who feels the same and can relate to me?  Anyway, sorry for wasting your time, anyone who might stumble across this post. Hope you're well."
"There's a girl in one of my college classes who has been a mystery to me for so long. Let outline what she's like: She wears the same outfit every single day. Boots, leggings, and a pink shirt. Occasionally she wears a pink tutu. All of her stuff is pink- binders, pencils, book covers, backpack, etc. She never speaks, when she does it's very high pitched and timid. She shaves her head. The sides near the ears are little shaven down with what I think is a razor. The main portion of her head is shaved down to about a cm in length, except for three long strands in the back of her head. One goes down her back, and the other two go around her shoulders to the front. Her hair is always like this. Always.  She spends 50% of class looking in a mirror constantly fixing her hair and the little pink bow ties she places in it.  She is constantly fixated in her outfit.  My question is what is wrong with her? Mental disability? Body dismorphia?"
"I was always really good in elementary school. I could focus for hours, and could enjoy reading and actually comprehend and remember what I had read. I started to slip out of it in middle school, but I feel like I've gone to hell in high school. I'm 16 and I'm finding it very hard to focus. I am in many AP classes, but I can't focus well enough to study, which is really affecting my grades. Reading a page in a textbook is basically impossible for me because my mind is constantly wandering. I can't even get through a few sentences before I realize I am off-track. My family never talked much about mental health, but I know that depression (I think bipolar) runs in my mom's side, and there is addiction in my dad's side. I'm not sure about anything regarding ADHD. I have experienced many periods in my life where I've felt depressed, but a lot of this started when I was in 6th grade, where around the same time, my parents divorced and I came home to see my house covered in blood and my dog laying dead (two of my dogs had gotten in a fight while I was away at school, and I was the first to come home to see it). My grandparents are kind of the only ones to try to talk to me about my parents' divorce, but I always refused to communicate when I was younger. I still don't like talking about it, even though I think I am okay with the entire situation. I have tried to bring up the subject of anxiety to my mom because I believe she has gone through similar things, but she told me it was probably just because I am a teenage girl and am going through a lot. Is this stuff that everyone goes through or could I have an actual problem? I am afraid to talk to my mom about it because I don't want to get shot down again. I usually act okay around different people but I struggle so much with communication, and with anxiety and focusing while I am alone. I think I act very impulsively and I become super obsessed with things and then usually drop them a week or so later. I can't afford to go to a doctor or psychiatrist.   This is a lot of information but I have also experience a lot of mood swings but that has always been blamed on hormones. I can't focus on things I really enjoy such as reading or watching TV because I feel trapped and like I need to hop on to another activity."

"I'm going off of ambien in two weeks due to the research showing the affects of long term benzo use, my question is what can I expect going on remeron?"
"I am a freshman in college and come from a small town with a complicated past to leave behind, including a multitude of family issues, especially surrounding my parents. I am paying my own way through college four hours away from home. Sometimes the stress is honestly unbearable. I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness, but I have also never sought out treatment...the point of me posting this is my worry that I may be harboring things that are causing me mental illness. Lately, my boyfriend and I (a serious committed relationship, we talk about the future a lot, love each other, etc) keep getting in arguments because I can't seem to be truly happy these past few weeks. I feel like a burden to him; his family is wealthy and they have the best intentions, but they also are aware of my bad background and sometimes I just feel like a charity case. School just started back, I'm working a part time job every other day, and I just recently learned some pretty disturbing things about my past, and its just bringing more troubling things up that I've avoided all of these years. I feel as though my past makes it hard for me to truly open up to my boyfriend, but he is all I really have. We spend all of our time together, and it gets overwhelming for him to see me go days without cracking a smile or wanting to get out of bed. I can't stand to be around people anymore, and when I watch my peers joke and laugh together and see other people my age make posts about going out and doing fun things, it makes me really sad and frustrated with myself for not being able to make myself be enthusiastic about any of this...I'm constantly worrying about my future, worrying about my parents' impression of me, worrying because of the uncertainty of it all...I guess my point of this post really is just to get some advice on if these feelings should be something to speak with a professional about. I know I just have to change my mindset and find some motivation within myself, but everyday when I wake up and think about the world we live in, my lack of friends, and my messed up family situation I can't help but want to be anyone but me...I try to think positively, keep a journal, and try to smile at myself in the mirror but it just leads to more frustration. I don't know if I'm just holding myself back, because I am truly trying to be the happy college student I should be, but its just been really hard this past month specifically. I'm sorry this post is really scattered; I'm just trying to get my thoughts down. Thank you for reading and I'm definitely open for discussion about this and want complete honesty on what you guys think would be my next best move or if I do need to see a therapist or psychiatrist."
"I never get quality sleep. I was using melatonin, but I adapted, so I added Trazodone. Trazodone nor melatonin work for me on their own. I'm sure that this combo is increasing my fatigue, so I want a different sleeping prescription.    I think that it is linked to anxiety. Maybe I should ask for Valium, instead? Is daily Valium unhealthy?"
"Hello, I thank you for clicking on my post! I understand there is no better information than talking to a doctor about my problem. And I am! A psychiatrist and psychologist. The only problem is, is that they are both confused on how I am showing symptoms of both.   Borderline Personality Disorder's symptoms are: -Having an unstable or dysfunctional self-image or a distorted sense of self (how one feels about oneâ€™s self) -Feelings of isolation, boredom and emptiness -Difficulty feeling empathy for others -A history of unstable relationships that can change drastically from intense love and idealization to intense hate -A persistent fear of abandonment and rejection, including extreme emotional reactions to real and even perceived abandonment -Intense, highly changeable moods that can last for several days or for just a few hours -Strong feelings of anxiety, worry and depression Impulsive, risky, self-destructive and dangerous behaviors, including reckless driving, drug or alcohol abuse and having unsafe sex -Hostility -Unstable career plans, goals and aspirations  Schizophrenia symptoms are: -Auditory hallucinations -Delusions (beliefs that are not real; false personal beliefs that are not subject to reason or contradictory evidence.) -Anxiety -Anger Detachment (the patient may sometimes be physically or emotionally; reserved and remote.) -Aggression and violence -Condescension -Suicidal thoughts and behavior  Facts about me: -Occasionally hear someone whispering about me. -During periods of my life felt I was being watched my a secret alien organization that was going to take me away. I had to monitor my thoughts and actions as to not upset them. -Very high anxiety to where I do not like going out in public. -Constantly feel out-of-touch with reality / it is as if I am on a different plain of existence as everyone else. -At times felt the terrifying presence of someone hostile in the room with me-- I am stricken with terror. -Lately I am a shut-in / I only truly communicate with my understanding partner. -I FEAR abandonment, even if it is imagined (it usually is). -At times felt detached from myself / felt emotionally and cognitively stunted, while at the same time someone (me?) was constantly singing in my head. -I almost always feel empty inside. -Severe bouts of suicidal ideology and mental anguish, sometimes followed by manic behaviors. -Irrational anger in high levels / hostility -Extreme or stunted emotional responses -Depression -At times felt like everyone was out to get me or cause me harm.    These are just my main issues. I have others, but the list is long as it is...  I am high functioning considering these problems; I hold down a part-time job and a high gpa in College.  If anyone has any insight, please let me know. Thank you."
"Hi,  So I'm not convinced I'm depressed or anything in the usual sense, but then not convinced I'm ok? So just really looking for any advice or whether you think I'm just overthinking things and lazy!  -Sleep, completely messed up, I get to sleep around 2 every morning, sometimes later, and wake up around 8 (and struggle to get up)- I'm normally awake so late because I've been doing my homework that I haven't done in the evening because I'm too lazy and procrastinate - but I think it's become routine   -I seem to have ups and downs throughout the day, and then every few weeks as well. Like I'm normally in what I presume to be a normal/good mood at school, but then normally more negative at home, but then go up as it gets later if that makes sense? And then for about a week a month I feel really good and not down at all, like I get on with work and clean my room etc.  -I play sport twice a week, but I no longer look forward to it and would be quite happy to quit (I feel this whether I'm up or down)  -Can get very negative and self critical, especially in the evenings, less so in the day time. Think I'm very lazy etc.  -I think I isolate myself from my friends and family too (although might just be the way I view)   -Unrelated but I'm very shy and have little self confidence/future plans (I'm 17)  There's a few more things but this is too long already, sorry! Thank you for any help!"
"What is the difference here? I imagine everyone hears A voice, right? Like, when you are thinking, you hear a voice that basically reads your thoughts to you. Anyways, so what is the difference between forced or unwanted thoughts/invasive thoughts and an hallucination? I sometimes have a very difficult time concentrating because my thinking voice keeps getting off track. Making it difficult to for example, read a book. I think you undestand what i mean.  Neither auditory hallucinations, nor your own thoughts are actually real, external sounds, but merely a product of your own mind. So what seperates these two things?"
"Under a lot stress now as a result, my ankles are swollen. I'm having panic attacks like crazy. Someone please tell me what I need to do to fix them or at least how long until they go away?"
"Just basic background: I suffer from depression, anxiety, anorexia (this no longer symptomatic or at least much less so), and was thought to have suffered from PTSD at one time but this no longer affects me. I've never been on drugs. Tried one for less than a week (Wellbutrin), and it was a disaster--affected me in the exact opposite way it was supposed to (couldn't keep my eyes open, was like being drunk, couldn't think straight), and there are no other options for me specifically according to every doctor I've seen. Seen three psychiatrists, none of them helped and actually most of them have been hurtful or said very offensive things to me and prescribed drugs I'd never take in a million years. I've gone to therapy on and off for maybe three years, seen three therapists, two of them rather long term and consistent.   To me, therapy has done and continues to do nothing for me. I keep thinking I'll find the right therapist or have some kind of breakthrough out of nowhere, but it simply doesn't happen. I'm an open book in my life. I write constantly and have a best friend who knows literally everything about me and has known me since I was a child, we can talk about ANYTHING, and I also have a boyfriend that I can be very open with about everything. I've never had to hold anything in, I've never been in denial about anything, I've always been able to figure out my emotions and problems by myself by writing it out and then with my friend and boyfriend in more extreme situations. (I'm lucky, I have great support.) I think MAYBE twice have I learned something new/heard something I've never heard before from a therapist in all the years of therapy. There's nothing a therapist brings up or tries to work through with me that I haven't already worked out and dissected myself at one point. All my current therapist does is tell me I'm too hard on myself, and if I'm in a good mood all he does is tell me how well I'm doing and how energized I am. Nothing he says or does solves any of my problems, he just tells me what I already know. In fact, I find that going to therapy forces me to try and think of negative things in my life when I wouldn't otherwise think of those things. Therapy either depresses me or does absolutely nothing. I know I'm in a good place now or an up as it were, and that I'll be VERY depressed and suicidal again in a month or whatever, but it doesn't change my opinion about wanting to stop going to therapy. It doesn't help me in those moments either. And at least now I know that it's coming and that I can handle it on my own. I believe I'm just one of those people that's not sick enough to get any actual help and not well enough in general to feel that I don't need help. Unfortunately, therapy seems to only be for people who don't know how to talk to people or acknowledge their own feelings? Is it stupid to leave therapy? Should I just find a new therapist?  Sorry for such a long post. Does anyone else feel like this? I just don't think it's worth the weekly copay or time. Never has been, never will be. Can I handle it all on my own?"
"I was prescribed with antidepressant called deanxit to help me deal with anxiety over something that happened in the past. i took two pills for 2 weeks and it has no effects on me, i called the doctor and she told me to take half a pill of zoloft 50 mg, and i have been taking them for 20 days now and im dealing with minor side effects such as headaches and difficulty waking up in the morning, but i am still anxious about the same thing and cant get it out of my mind, my reaction to thinking about it changed as i dont get as emotional as i used to. do you think that i should continue with zoloft or antidepressants just dont work for me.  i know i should ask the doctor but mental health issues are not covered in my insurance and its really expensive in my country."
It makes me so anxious not knowing the time. Why do they not let patients have watches or have clocks in any room?
"Hello,  I am a journalist in the UK who specializes in mental health issues, as I suffer from ADHD and OCD myself. I am doing a documentary on mental health in India, but I am going to focus not on the more severe (whatever that means) but less common mental disorders - a la Schizophrenia - and on the most common disorders - ADHD, OCD, and non-debilitating varieties of Anxiety and Depression. In essence, I want to see how people with mental illnesses that are serious but not totally debilitating, function within a sparse mental health system. I chose India not to navel gaze but because all countries, developing and developed, have insufficient mental illness policy and are filled with stigma, I want to show the more severe side of that stigma and poor resources in play with more 'common' illnesses, and, in addition, my partner is from India and has experience with this in his life. In any case, sorry for the long post but I just wanted to reach out to users to get reactions. Though I suffer from mental illness, I'm still have many gaps of knowledge and am ripe with ignorance. Is there any way you would recommend to reach out to a mental health community? What do you think I should be in particular sensitive to in talking to people with these disorders? In general just your thoughts on the topic would be much appreciated. Thank you all!"
"I belong in the olden days of right winged conservatism and those precedents, beliefs and attitudes. I'm an anomaly and fundamentally, seriously do not belong here! Liberals these days are making me desperately want to go to war or kill myself... I'm becoming more insane then Charles Manson. I get off on and masturbate to watching left winged people being bashed and tortured on liveleak. I am born in the wrong time and this is fucking hell (worse then hell)! Im physically, and mentally sick because psychologically this amount of stress and madness causes me to be in an unbelievable amount of agonising excruciating pain (terrible migraines and flu like symptoms all the time) I'm fucking miserable. I am seriously fundamentally only very disturbed and batshit crazy because of liberals! If I move to North Korea or Russia everything would be absolutely fine I'm like a one sided genius right winged robot essentially. (Or something similar/equivalent) Yeah. I am very much insane unless people behave and think with right winged beliefs. I'm very insane. What the fuck is wrong with me haha? I don't care if you are: transsexual, pan sexual, homosexual or bi-sexual and etc. I could actually have sex with Milo Yiannopolous just for the fuck off it (even though I'm not gay and just to screw with the minds of liberals a bit more) As long as everyone is right winged I'm fine... I'm insane if people drift off from stereotypical rightism to liberal regressive left winged social ideologies. I need things a certain way. ( I'm like a computer program) I need set functions, operations, precedents, behaviours and etc... If everything becomes acceptable and tolerated and there's no security in my behaviours. With the computer analogy I'll become like a virus running out of control... Which is similar to what is happening to me at the moment! It's fucked up I need laws, rules and precedents and stereotypical conservative norms."
"I have SAD and for the first time since diagnosis (2 years ago), I'm dating someone. We've been together for 6 months and we started off really well, but now my depression is putting a wedge between us. He has a really high libido but mine is now basically non-existent and he's complained about it several times. Also, I feel really distant and disconnected from him. He's making a really good effort to find the right balance between supporting me and giving me space, yet I feel like I need even more space. I feel horrible because I don't know if it's the depression or if the chemistry just isn't there anymore. So, my question that I've been pondering for the last few weeks is, do you think it's selfish for someone with SAD or any type of depression to date? I know he loves me and I think deep down I love him too, the depression has just made me lose sight of it. But I feel like I'm hurting him just by existing, which causes me to shut him out in an effort to protect him. For some reason I believe that keeping my distance will be less painful for him than exposing him fully to the horrors of my depressed mind. When I told him how bad it had gotten, he cried for 15 minutes and I never felt shittier about myself. Please advise me, I'm in between therapists and need all the help from you I can get!"
"i don't know whats wrong with me but everytime i try to concentrate really hard on activities i seem to remember very cringey memories that i instantly feel awkward about  There is this common 'thing' that happens to our minds after being isolated from mind stimulating social situations. Memories come back as sounds, you start to hear voices, you start catasrophizing every little detail/event in your life.  I've noticed after i graduated highschool in 2015, they intensely occurred more often. So am i not distracting my mind enough ?   Background: Grew up with refugee parents working full time at their business and a older sister suffering from schizoprenia. There's mental illness in my ancenstral roots somewhere but i don't want to believe that mental illnesses are real.  I'd consider it a imbalance of our mental states that can be nurtured by healthy constant activity and relationships.   TLDR : Memories come back as sounds too often its driving me nuts."
What do you like and what do you not like about them?
I get this A lot. I feel like my ability to see changes in a way that is hard to explain. What could cause this? Thanks!

"Hey guys :)  To those of you who are doing therapy: what are your symptoms and what's your diagnosis? Is there any progress, are you getting better?   Thanks :)"
"I would go to a therapist but I always feel so shitty when I do. Is it possible to work on my own problems? If so, how would that be done?"
"I have a friend, let's call him Eric, who has been acting a bit wierd towards another one of my friends, let's call him Jack. Lately, Eric has been suspecting Jack of constantly conniving against him to split up the rest of his friends with him. He interprets the simplest of actions as some sort of planning against him. Jack and Eric have known each other for 6-7 years now and are very close friends, but over the past year, their relationship has been growing worse mainly because Eric can't deal with being around Jack, he randomly has times where he breaks down and has to leave the room. Afterwards, Eric rants to his other friends over text, cussing out Jack and talking about how he is constantly trying to separate his friends from him. Jack is a very kind guy who would do nothing of the sort, and is also very confused at Eric's random breakdowns and issues. Eric does not show this to Jack though, and pretends to be normal around him. Jack does not know what is going on with him, but I am worried about his mental health, please provide any help for diagnosis if possible."
"I was really sad again today. I keep thinking about everything that's happened and I freaked out because I realized that I can't remember the last time I was actually, truly happy. I've just kind of been surviving. Not living. But just taking it day by day. The things he said to me really fucked me up. I thought I could just get over it, but it's been really hard.  I've been struggling like this for 6 years. What he said to me, wasn't anything I haven't heard before. I've been saying that to myself everyday for years. The only thing that got me through was that 1% of my mind that could connect back to reality and tell me that, it's only my brain telling me those things. I was numb to the whole situation because I was so used to it. It took every once of energy in my body just to find that 1%. Quite honestly, that 1% is the only thing that has really kept me alive this long. That is the only reason I didn't do anything stupid to myself all those times I wanted to. I had hope that there was a reality outside of my brain that was better then the reality that I was living and that I would get back there some day.  When he said those things to me, the same things I've been saying to myself for 6 years, it took that reality away from me. All of a sudden, I didn't have that expectation, that goal that I was working towards anymore. It made me feel like nothing could ever get better. That every painful thing my brain had told me, was true. I deserve everything. I always fuck everything up. I do nothing but hurt everyone else. That's all my brain knows. I'm not suicidal by definition. I don't have a plan, I'm not going to consciously hurt myself. I don't need to be kept away from sharp objects, or guns, or ropes. Sometimes, when I'm driving I think, if my brakes went out, or someone T-boned me and I died, I wouldn't mind. Or when I have a cold I think, I don't care if I get sick. I don't care if I die of pneumonia in the hospital.  Being suicidal doesn't always mean wanting to die. It's just means not wanting to live anymore. The hardest part of depression is knowing what's happening, but not being able to do anything about. From the very beginning, I could see it happening. I say every sign and symptom. Not taking care of myself, isolation, loss of motivation, irritability, losing weight, all of it. I saw it happening. It was kind of like, I was outside of myself. I was looking at my life from and outside view. Even though I saw everything happening I couldn't stop it. At first I tried trust me. I wanted so badly to find myself again and to be myself again. But it felt like I was trapped in a fish tank that was slowly filling with water. I tried to get away from it; I was beating on the glass and screaming as I felt the water slowly creeping up. I fought against it for as long as I could, but I was drowning. Now, I still see it happening. I can still see myself from the outside, but now I'm not fighting anymore. I'm under the water, looking through the glass at myself, at how much I need to be saved, but I have no motivation or energy to save myself anymore. I've tried. I've been trying. I'm tired.  When he said those things to me. It not only broke my heart, but it took away my reality. It took my sanity. It took my hope.  I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm not going to do anything stupid. But I lost sight of things getting better. I've lost motivation to try to help myself. I've lost the little bit of hope that I had.  It fucked me up. Fucked me up worse then I already was. I never thought it would get this bad."
"I am an 18 year old male, and I have been diagnosed as a maniac, and i am going to a mental hospital locked up with a female psychopath whos 22 years old, help?"
"I don't know what to do. I'm scared to leave my house often due to family issues, i don't have any decent means of transportation or an income. All my friends are off far away at college. I'm constantly stressed or feeling guilty whenever somebody else is home, and nobody is helping. I'm too afraid to ask others i know for help because i don't know if i can take more lack of care or betrayal. I'm afraid to even try to get better anymore. At this point i want to want to make an effort most the time. I don't have money for professional help, i even tried a few online therapy chat session things, but i just kept seeing pay walls. If i can't get out, can't make progress at home, and keep spiraling, then what the hell do i do? I don't want to die, but i know i won't be able to stop myself once my mental breakdowns get to a certain level, and they're getting close now. All the collateral damage i set up to stop myself is becoming meaningless."
"Alright, im doing a short film, I need to know, what type of stuff would a psychologist say to someone with depression"
"To remind myself I'm a strong woman who takes no shit.  I was going to throw them out, they brought up bad memories. But I didn't want to give a t-shirt or memory that kind of power.   I hope other rape/sexual assault survivors out there might channel their feelings in the same way. It was never your fault.   I was going to post a photo but decided against it due to my ongoing settlement negotiations."
"I don't know what to do, I'm not suicidal but daily tasks are becoming harder and harder. Can anyone offer any self care tips they perform for their anxiety that aren't as harmful as alcohol?"
"I am a very anxious person, luckily it's high functioning. I'm proud of myself because a week ago, I made my very first doctor's appointment by myself, I went to it this morning, I managed to talk about all my negative traits without crying, I went to pick up my prescription, and I even managed to have energy left when I got home to do some chores. I am very proud of myself and much happier even in comparison to last week just because I know I can do things and I shouldn't let my mental disorders get in the way if I can control it. My boyfriend is lovely and said we can research psychiatrists when he gets home so I can get further help and pin point the problem. I am so proud and excited to get help and I'm ready to lead a normal life.   Edit: I also have Borderline Personality disorder but since I haven't been to a doctor since that diagnosis, they decided to take it easy and just start me as a high anxiety diagnosis and we'll work up from there so the benzos or whatever they would've given me doesn't shock my system since I'm sensitive to medication. But having BPD is ultimately what makes this, and every other aspect in life very hard to deal with."
"Hello,  I am a 19 year old female and have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features and generalized anxiety disorder. I am currently on 100 mg of Zoloft and I have recently switched birth controls. I was on the generic for Yasmin but, since the 23rd of December, have been on the generic for Yas. I was doing fine on it until I reached toward the end of the pack. I started to become very hostile, apathetic, severe mood swings, severely depressed and anxious, aggravated, argumentive, tearful, overthinking everything, panic attacks, even suicidal at times. I'm going back and forth as to whether this is just really bad pms that is affecting my mental state or if I'm genuinely going into another episode. This is the first time that I have felt this miserable since my last episode a little over a year ago. This has caused me to be very hostile and argumentive toward my boyfriend who I love very much. It is frightening and concerning to me and those around me. I feel like I have no control over my mind and I am desperate for advice and help. Thank you so much for reading and thank you to anyone who is willing to give me advice.  Peace and love."
I'm clueless and need to help myself soon. I don't really have anyone I can ask about this. I have been dealing with anxiety and depression (self diagnosed so who knows) for few years now. I am a 20 year old college student (male) and currently only have a therapist.
"I'm soon tapering down to 10mg. Will I feel the difference? Also, am I likely to lose some of the weight gain? I think I lost some when I went down to 15 from 20.  I'm hoping my connection to music really comes back. Although I love playing I am constantly emotionally numb. I also hope some of my physical energy comes back."
"I'm hoping someone has some advice on what I should do/how I can get help.  I've been on sertraline for anxiety and depression for ~15 years, generally 50-75mg/day, and I'm facing the very scary possibility of completely running out of medication. I'm facing a perfect storm of events:  1) My long-term psychiatrist retired and did not renew his license, 2) My old insurance (through Cobra) terminated 12/31, 3) My new insurance isn't active until 2/1 (because NYS of Health massively screwed things up and didn't meet their own deadlines - I have been fighting with them), 4) I could not find a doc to see me before the end of the year, 5) My medication at the dosage I'm supposed to be on would run out the first week in February, and 6) I've had to go down to 50mg from 75mg because of the fear of running out of medication, and the lower dose isn't cutting it.  I can't even find a psychiatrist that will allow me to make an appointment until I have an insurance ID number for them, which I may not have until a week or more after my coverage goes into effect. Waiting periods around here can be weeks or months. I am so, so scared of running out of medication and facing severe withdrawal, not to mention how terrible I feel on a lower dose.  If I can't get a new prescription before I run out - what should I do? Do I go to the emergency room/urgent care? Is it possible my regular doctor could write me a prescription if I bring in my records, or that a primary care doctor that hadn't seen me before WOULD write me a prescription provided I had my records? (With the insurance switch, I might lose my current PCP too, and I know the office has expressed a reluctance to prescribe anything for someone seeing a psychiatrist in the past...)"
"So I'm a non-offending pedophile.   I was abused as a kid, so I know what it's like and what it does to you. That's the main thing that keeps it in check most of the time. But quite often, I really struggle with it. It's not as if you can just avoid children, but they're everywhere.   I really don't want to ruin some kid's life, nor do I want to ruin my life.   I don't even really know why I'm posting this, but I've never been able to tell anyone, so here I am. I did tell a shrink once, but they didn't take it well  I've never viewed CP, and I don't plan to. Doing so just increases the demand for more.  Anyway, quite often, I will follow girls around at the store or wherever and leer at them. I know it's fucking creepy, but I can't help it.  I really hate myself for this :("
"Hey all,  Thought this would be a good place to ask - had a call from my girlfriend at 9:30am this morning after she'd been on a night out in town last night. She'd gone back to a friend's house with her flatmate at around 5am and was, I imagine, pretty drunk, but then started thinking that she was in a prison and ran off, leaving all her belongings with her housemate (shoes included).   She was sober enough to recount taking 2 hours to walk home, with people apparently even stopping to give her money because they thought she was homeless. Eventually she got back to the apartment around 9am, and was having delusions about 'being in a prison' until her flatmate got back at 9:30 and told her otherwise, and then she called me.  Things worth noting:  - She's never experienced anything like that before - She was in a room where they were smoking marijuana, but reckons she didn't smoke any. - She was seemingly sober, or certainly not wasted, when I spoke to her, which is slightly concerning seeing as she was still pretty delusional until half an hour beforehand. - She's 22, and probably drinks more than she should. Does not take drugs.  So, simple enough really - should I be worried? I'm not sure if the symptoms of delusion are symptomatic of having her drink spiked perhaps, or if something more sinister is going on mentally. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Cheers - Jake."
"Certainly, depression manifests itself in many different ways. Sometimes it has multiple causes and not just one. To elaborate on my question: Is there a way to determine if the depression is caused by some of the things we do, or do we do the things we do because we are depressed? If we change our behavior will that help, or should we focus on the depression itself and hope we correct our behavior once the depression has subsided?  &amp;nbsp;  Just as a simple example: Someone who is depressed might also have bad personal hygiene and a messy home. Do they have bad hygiene and a messy home due to the depression, or did the bad hygiene and messy home cause the depression? How can we tell?  &amp;nbsp;  Do we cause depression by doing/not doing things, or do we do/not do things as a result of being depressed?  &amp;nbsp;  TL;DR Fix my depression to fix my life, or fix my life to fix my depression?  &amp;nbsp;  edit - added question mark?"
"I'll try my best not to go on an emotional rant about my situation, so I will give only details you may need to make a suggestion. I am looking for a suggestion on what kind of help I should seek. I don't know where to start. I have never been to therapy before, but I NEED to do *something* to get me fixed up.   Here are my concerns and problems:   * Mentally/physically abusive. This is not as bad as you'd think, but it is still there. It's really when I lose my cool due to anger/anxiety.  * Anger management  * Being somewhat controlling (not wanting SO to text guy friends who she doesn't see are gross)  * Focus problems (medicated for ADHD now, but open to suggestions of it being a symptom of something else)  * Anxiety (medicated for now, Zoloft, not on it long enough for effectiveness)  * General discontent, feeling of no purpose, boredom, isolation  * I guess, feeling like I'm always right. (however, I don't know if this is a problem, *most* of the time I **am** right. Or I will argue a point that can't be disproved, so I *can't* actually be wrong.)  * PTSD from last breakup (not sure if PTSD is a good way to describe it, but it's all I could think of.)  My main goal is to fix the problems that will affect my intimate relationships. I do not know if ex is willing to participate in these therapy sessions if able.   If you would like more details, please let me know. I tried to be as vague as possible so I didn't spill my heart to this subreddit.   My mother has already suggested EFT, because she has soldier friends who have had very good luck with this particular person.   If you suggest a therapy, and know of a medication alternative that can be used instead, or in combination with therapy, please let me know. I want to be able to take this information and do some research from the results.   Thank you"
"For the last couple years I have been seeking treatment for my mental health issues, which has included taking medication. Since I started that process however, my mind basically has felt like mush. My memory has declined and and it is difficult for me to keep track of everything I need to. Over the last week I have been tapering off of my current (and likely final) medication, which has made this issue worse (among other things, difficult week). I'm hoping once I get this stuff cleared out of my system things will improve a little, but my question for you is, how do you stay on top of your life when you have mental health issues and/or are taking medication? I've tried checklists, routines, numerous apps and still keep making unintentional mistakes everywhere."
"Not sure if this is an appropriate place, but I figured you guys would have some insight  This girl and I have been talking off and on for like a month, things were going great, we went on a date, everything was great  After the date she all of a sudden just went ghost on me, stopped texting me back, cancelled all our plans, etc.  I thought I did something to scare her off or something, until last night. She texted me at about midnight and explained that she suffers from depression, and with everything going on in her life lately, most of which I was already aware of, she started slipping again. And she didn't wanna tell me because she didn't wanna overwhelm or scare me off.  I told her that I really like her and I'll be here for her whenever she needs me, and that she never has to hide that kind of thing from me. I reassured her that she's not gonna scare me off with it. She thanked me for understanding, and that was the extent of the conversation.  Now, I've suffered with depression as well but I understand that everyone is different. I really want to be there as much as I possibly can but I also want to give her space. Like I've thought about at least checking in with her everyday just to see how shes doing, but I'm scared thsys took much. How do I support her through this whole at the same time giving her space?"
My doctor has referred me to have tests carried out on my mental health after hearing/seeing things  I would just like to know what to expect?
"They say once you've opened the door of remember you cannot close it again. I think the better question is how do I be a person again. I'm doing the therapy reading the books but I'm still socially fucking weird. 11 years of not telling to opening to chaos of truth. I know it's better to face it sooner than never. But maybe venting here will be my sanctuary. I haven't written my whole story now but it's coming. Maybe this was the wrong time to post if I'm not giving specifics. Just going to be social today and need some advice. Had a meltdown this morning, pulled my self together..kind of. I don't even know what I'm asking anymore."
"I'm honestly afraid for my aunt's life. Her name is Toni, and she has an 9 year old son named Keagon. I believe that Keagon shows signs of a serious mental illness, but I'd like advice as to what exactly he might have and what do to.  Keagon has acted out against his parents for probably a year or two, but recently, it's gotten a lot worse. Before, Keaton would often act out for what Toni presumed was attention. He wouldn't listen to Toni or anything she said, and would snap back at her. At the time, she thought it was just bad behavior or a rebellious streak. However, Toni's perception of him completely changed after one incident.  Toni and Keagon lived together alone in an apartment, as Toni was recently divorced. Multiple kids in that building came forward, though, and reported to the police that Keagon had sexually assaulted/ put unwanted sexual advances on them, and one child even reported an actual rape. Toni and Keagon were kicked out of their apartments because of it, and Toni moved in with her parents.  Ever since about them, it's gotten worse. Keaton has developed a horrible temper, uses language that even adults would consider excessive, and acts out physically; after getting into an argument with his sister (who lives with her father and was over for visitation), he tried to bash her head in with a baseball bat. He's lost any sort of discipline, and at this point I was starting to believe that he may have some sort of mental illness.  Today, though, Toni came to my father (her brother) and asked for help. She said that she is now afraid of her own son. According to her, he has no respect to her, telling her that he hates her, as well as hitting and kicking her with as much force as he can. While Toni and her recent fiancÃ© were in bed talking, Keagon demanded to be let in and tried to bust down their door with a baseball bat. He abuses their two dogs, enough that they are deathly afraid of him as well. He's even threatened to kill her, other people, and even himself. Yesterday, Keagon even chased Toni through the house with a butcher knife, and threw an arrow at her head. She legitimately thinks the only reason she isn't dead yet is because he's not strong enough to. She's afraid that when he gets violent enough and strong enough, that he will legitimately murder her.  I came here after hearing this, looking for advice as to what kind of mental disorder could cause Keagon to become such an active threat to himself in others. What might be have? What does Toni do?"
I'm 21 and for as long as I can remember between deaths and friends leaving and even the stuff I was told I should feel happy about and whatnot I feel nothing.   I am always lacking emotion and lately it's been really screwing with me. Even with no emotion sometimes the littlest things make me feel suicidal is the only word I can think of to describe it.   Suicidal as in when I'm driving irritated or inconvenience I look at my speed and thin things I'm driving past and wonder if itd be enough to end it. I don't act on it because what's the point? There's no proof that being dead is better than being alive.   The real reason I'm typing this out though is because this girl I guess loves me. She knows no bounds when it comes to making sure I'm comfortable and she'd be perfect to spend the rest of my life with but the problem is that I can't show emotion I can't even imitate it and she tries to force it out of me.   Help.
"Hey,  I had my last therapy session today and I'm wondering when and if I should be considering meds against depression. I think it'll make a difference between what path I'll choose and where I go to be treated. I know you can't really recommend me anything specific or give me advice regarding my situation, but I'm asking it in the general sense.  Thank you very much in advance, if there is anything I missed I'm happy to elaborate further"
"I have always had a low self esteem and been shy throughout school. I am in college now and seeing a therapist for social anxiety and such. It has been very helpful and my confidence has skyrocketed! But after reading and thinking about life values, I realized the only reason I go to school, workout, seek therapy, and try to improve is to show everybody in my life that I am not a shy loser. This need has come from years of being socially awkward, rejection, and some bullying. I know I should not care about what other people think and I don't as much now. I am just lost. What's the point of doing anything? How should I find purpose? I don't know what I care about now. I wanted for the longest time to rub my success in the faces of others who have wronged me. I fantasized about it all the time. I realize now that's probably not ok because nobody has done anything to me that I cannot get over. How do I find healthy reasons to keep improving? Am I using the right sub? so many questions"
"I've been trying to find a good, lasting combo of meds for depression and anxiety for several years now. Everytime I find something that seems to work, it wears off after a while.   The side effects are killing me. This latest dose increase has me sleeping 17hrs a day and my weight shot up 25lbs in 2 months. Just spoke to my doc and lowered the dose back down, but still.   At least I'm not mentally where I was a couple years ago, in and out of hospitals. Still don't feel that great but at least I'm not self harming or suicidal.   How do you guys do it? I feel like the search will never end. Like I'll always feel like shit. Ugh."
I've been reading about happiness and positive psychology and one aspect of it is feeling positive emotions. I realized I don't feel emotions. How am I supposed to enjoy life when I don't feel the good things?   Also I believe I have no personality. Everyone says I'm quiet which I am. I have trouble coming up with meaningful things to say. Do you think my meds make me like this? I'm on antidepressant and antipsychotic.
"Hi, let me start off with a little bit of background. I am a 21 year old male, recently single, college drop out. I have been seeing the world in a darker tone(metaphorically speaking). I don't trust many people, I feel like I don't have a purpose (actually more like I know). I can't seem to shake the feeling that I am going to end up very empty inside going towards this path.  I feel like it started when I went to college. I was still dating my then still in high school girlfriend who loved an hour away from my campus. I had been drug free and alcohol free up until this point, I was about 19. My girlfriend was a frequent toker, and I never considered leaving her for it. However, after 2 terms at school, I decided to give smoking weed a chance, I got super stoned that night and I got subway on campus-needless to say it was a good time! The problem began to arise when I realized how shitty it was paying for weed all the time when I wanted to smoke, which I guess became a pretty big habit. I started smoking before and after classes, skipping sometimes to smoke, keep in mind my school had a vast trail system perfect for my activities lol.   So the next school year rolls around and my grades started faltering, I then started failing some classes, got academic probation, and the next semester I just gave up for some reason. This is really where it went downhill. 1 semester down and these 2 more to go, I failed utterly the 2nd semester. I got lazier, left town to see my girlfriend more. I wanted to blame weed but I know it's still my choice to smoke. So I got academic dismissal for failing too much, and I also have more school tuition to pay that the financial aid wouldn't pay for because of my grades. Oh ya and all throughout my last year here I had 2 credit cards with $700 limit, and I stopped caring and maxed both of those out with the help of my girlfriend. Super irresponsible on my part.   So what do I do? I don't tell my parents who support me a little for college Financials, but it's mostly paid for by aid, instead I have been keeping it secret. I said that I am taking a break and they did not know I got dismissed, I still have fees, and I have credit cards maxed.  Now I work as a cook and make terrible pay, bad hours, and it's not what I want to do. I used to like working on computers but now I feel like I don't like anything. I can't make any payments and I'm struggling just to have a vehicle to make it to work. I pay my parents monthly for insurance and the car which we bought from Craigslist.   I just don't see a point to life anymore. I don't like how all life is relying on money and the likes, I just want to live a peaceful existence I guess and my mind doesn't want to try anymore. I have cut back on toking, a few times a week. But my mind really never feels clear. I've always had really poor short term memory and attention. The weed maybe affects it? I don't think it's very significant. I am scared to go to a doctor because I don't know what I would tell him. Maybe it's anxiety from my situation, or maybe it's some sort of depression or attention issue that has been surfacing? I just looking for some answers I guess and some audience. Thanks for reading anyone  P. S. If there was a way for me to move to a new country and start a new, I think I'd like that. No startup money unfortunately but I really I've always had this passion for IT that I don't think will go away"
"Currently, I have severe anxiety, ptsd, sever and crippling panic attacks, and agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is very, very hard to deal with as it is almost impossible to feel safe and on guard when anywhere but my house. My current land lord has decided to not renew our lease, and I have a month to find somewhere to go. I know this is a pretty specific situation, but please. Any kind of advice would be much appreciated, I'm slowly losing hope. Not suicidal, not into self harm, but I have no foreseeable options. Anything will help, even just words of encouragement. My only good friends have all passed away in the last couple years and now I feel like I have nobody to turn to. The Internet probably isn't the right place to turn, but I'm all out of options. Thanks"
I work somewhere where there was a shooting the victim was killed and bled out in my work. I'm still working there and occasionally deal with some ptsd from the event I slowly am getting better but one thing that hasn't at all is my sex drive. I nearly never am in the mood (with time I can be put into it by my significant other) but other than that I am nearly never. On top of this I feel like my penis never grows to it's full length if that makes sense. I wanted to go to ask Reddit but the rules there would not allow for this question.
"Not sure if this is the place for this post but im desperate.   So she has been using mdma heavily, for the last 5 months. Maybe once every 2 weeks, and tonight something crazy happened.   When we went to sleep she thought that there was gonna be monsters attacking her the moment she falls asleep so therefor she cant sleep. This resulted in us having to stay up all night and this really worries me.   I already know she has anxiety but this seems much more extreme, she also began saying that she is scared of the dark, so scared that she would only speak when the light was on, and that she would only be able to sleep when it isnt dark outside anymore. Also she has been experiencing some auditory hallucinations of people or these monsters walking around her.  We are both 18 years old, and im really worried for her. Neither of us know what to do and she doesnt want to feel like this anymore. Any help appreciated!"
"Hello, I am a 17 year old junior in high school. I've been trying to do research to see what the problems I've been having are, as my mom's insurance can not pay for therapy and I want to look into things myself. Obviously nothing I do can replace an actual medical diagnosis and I understand that, but a general idea would be nice.   So lately I've been doing really badly. I cry almost every day, and have for months. Usually it is in the shower or when I'm in bed, although occasionally it is in school and I have to excuse myself to cry in the bathroom stall. I've broken down in front of my mother twice, for very small things I might add.   I cry usually because I feel very ugly. In my sane moments I realize I am a relatively fit 17 year old with nothing to worry about but these waves of depression come sometimes and I feel like the ugliest person in the world. I have even stayed home from school because of this.   To add to this, I often shake uncontrollably at school. People ask me why I'm shaking and I have no answer for them. I suspect anxiety as it occurs in my lower moments but I'm not sure.   Occasionally I have bursts of energy and feel I could run ten miles. Then at the drop of a hat I could return to a depressed state.   To add to this I have intense anxiety about my future. In many moments I feel like I will be a loser in life no matter what I do. I feel that I do a poor attempt of appearing normal in public and that everyone can see right through me.   Ever since I was a kid I had trouble speaking to strangers, having to take speech classes for much of elementary school. I also was and still am easily confused by simple directions, and my mind wanders off when people lecture for longer than 5 minutes. I am also incredibly untidy, and more than one teacher have told me I am the messiest student they have ever met. My mom says this is just laziness.  Does anyone have any idea what this might be?    Edit: thank you to the nice people who helped me out here but this really wasn't what I was looking for"
"I'm 15, I know that's young. When I was younger, maybe 6-8 I had a PC. This computer had no, and I mean no restrictions. I saw gore, brains, porn, etc. I've seen dogs being thrown off cliffs. I was also sexually abused as a young kid around this age too by my older sister (she was 12-13, we still talk and I have never brought it up, I don't think it matters anymore legally speaking and I don't want to remind her of it because she could have been abused too which led her to act on me.)  I've completely forgiven her.  But - sometimes, I have thoughts. Thoughts I don't want to do, thoughts I don't act on.  They aren't impulsive thoughts, just what if?  I'll look at younger kids and think sometimes about me doing something to them. This has made me become uncomfortable around kids and about hearing stories of sexual abuse or molestation sometimes. I sometimes have thoughts about me raping someone, or killing someone.  Remember, these aren't impulsive thoughts but in a what would happen way if that makes sense. I'm been diagnosed with dysthmia, and am on Prozac (have been for about three weeks).  I'm scared. For others, for me and I just want to be normal. Is there something wrong with me?"
"Hello, I really need to ease my mind. This night i broke up with my gf after 2 years, my native language isn't English so i apologize for my grammar. I've been miserable in this relationship for the past year.   I was a socially active guy, I was in the same group of friends from kindergarten. Was active in a model glider club where I had dozens of friends over almost 10 years of activity. I was flying with a paraglider, lived life to the fullest. And then I met her, on new year's of 2015. We talked, were meeting over the next few weeks and started dating after a month.  Things were great, I was hanging out with my friends, with her friends, with her... It seem'd perfect, until after 6 months she began with jealousy. We started having fights every couple of days. She fought with me over why I was active on Facebook when we're not talking. Required me to talk to her almost 100% of the time I was awake. Even if we didn't have any topics to talk about, we had an mhm,yeah conversation for over hundreds of messages. I stopped talking to my friends, deleted facebook, wouldn't be allowed to greet old female friends from school without her judging me and fighting with me. I couldn't apply for any jobs because there would be girls and since I'm a man I would cheat on her. I loved her and didn't wan't to get in any fights, But every couple of months I was fed up and got in a fight with her explaining to her that if she cared for me she wouldn't do that stuff with me and that she needed to trust me. Trust was the only thing i wanted from her. I gave her everything.   Since I had a modest money income, being a techie guy and knowing how to fix stuff I always had a little money in my pocket. Not a lot but enough to not ask my parents for any and being able to buy me some stuff. I would always pay for everything, spent all my saving on visits to the city she's going in collage since she'd come only for the weekends..... Treating her the best i could. Literally my life became my room and her.   Now I have social anxiety with everyone else but her, I'm don't want to talk to my friends because I'm ashamed of how I didn't do anything for the past 2 years. I'm not going to the model glider club for the same reason. I'm obese, depressive and feeling misplaced. Having no idea what to do now and if i did the right choice. I went from feeling limitless and indestructible to feeling abandoned, lonely and unnecessary....   I'm sorry for all the I talk and if this isn't readable. I just wanted to get this of my mind. Even if none of you reply I feel better just for sharing."
"Hi there, Later in the year Iâ€™m putting on a non-profit art exhibition in County Durham, UK to educate and raise awareness about Bipolar Disorder. Iâ€™ve set up a crowdfunding page to cover the costs of the exhibition itself, but the money will also be going towards advertising local programmes, groups etc that offer help to those with bipolar disorder, as well as those with other mental health needs. There are too many people out there who need help but donâ€™t know where to get it, and I want to change that! I would really appreciate your help by giving my crowdfunding page a look, a shoutout via your social media or a donation. I canâ€™t do it without the communities help!  Crowdfunding page - www.crowdfunder.co.uk/the-bipolar-express/  If anyone has any questions or anything they can reach me through my website:- www.moonlightgems.co.uk  Thank you so much! Please please please take a look, donate and share! Love yas!"
"Okay I am not good at explaining how I feel, please bare with me. Okay so I am a 23 year old female and live with my boyfriend, he has been diagnosed with depression and ADHD(not sure if this is relevant but I am throwing that in there). Okay so this past week I have been feeling just... off, Like I said I am bad with words. I just started nursing school last week and you would think I would be super over the moon about it, it was a tough program and something I wanted for four years now but I am just overwhelmed and anxious. I was so excited when I got accepted I cried and orientation I printed out the packet and was so ready and now I am just... mah. I feel like I am in a rut? school, work(I work at school),home,boyfriend. I sit at home on the couch watch tv and play on my phone. I do not feel motivated for school,cooking, working out. Like in my mind I am so bored and I want to get up and do something I want to have fun and get things done but then I just cant?? I hope this makes sense I am having trouble understanding what is happening. I can not really find anything lately that has made me happy or excited. I have never been suicidal or anything if that makes a difference. Thank in advance for help."
"Hello, im a person. Many mental illnesses (Anxiety, Depression, Anger issues, Aspergers). I was posting on some other subs, and someone said that BDD was a possibility, i have a therapist but i usually go read up on any possible issues to make sure that i wont be wasting therapy time. Anyway, i thought it might be a possibility after it was suggested in another thread, and i read up on it. One of the symptoms is being obssesive over mirrors, or ignoring them which i do both of (Ignore with others, obssess when alone). Along with constant worry about appearance, to the point where i avoid social interaction. I started exercising to fix my body , and it might be turning into a obssesion where i lift alot of my free time, to speed the process up. I spend alot of time online looking up ways to be more attractive and how to look better sometimes in bad days, i spend a whole day doing exactly that, im most comfortable when my face is covered up. And i often wear clothing that covers my body quite a lot. Thanks! (If you need more details feel free to ask)"
I have no idea how to handle it. I have no idea how to cope with it. I have no idea what do. I don't feel like me. I feel like i have to recreate myself. I'm scared of my own mine. I don't know. Does anyone have tips on how to handle or cope with Bipolar 2?
"I'm trying really hard to bit sound like an ass here and I'm seriously just wondering if there is a legit reason why my co worker does the things she does.   I'm constantly irritated at this woman for various reasons. Mostly because she slacks on her duties and I have to clean up after her and do her work that she just can't do.   I (somewhat) believe her when she says she has back problems (although she is VERY dramatic about it, literally moaning and groaning so loud I get so uncomfortable). We are house keepers at a hotel and it can be pretty physically demanding (up and down stairs all day, squatting down, getting on hands and knees, lifting things etc.) she is older, I'd say maybe late 40's or early 50's. I can't say for sure because her physical appearance is rather deteriorated (I'm assuming drug use in earlier years but I can't say for certain). But beyond any physical limitations she make have she is just soooo heavily dramatic about it. As I mentioned she will moan and groan very loudly while working but she moans and grunts constantly. All the time. While sitting down, walking around, standing in one place (she does it even more noticeably while chewing and sucking on ice cubes, which she does all day), she is always softly moaning and it's very irritating and makes me somewhat uncomfortable but I'm wondering if this is some sort of mental disorder or something that she isn't really aware she is doing?  Socially she is rather awkward, she speaks very abruptly and loudly, most of the time interrupting others, and along with the constant moaning and grunting it's left her friendless (at least here at work).   My brother has Aspergers and she remind me of that in the social aspect but one of the things with Aspergers is they tend to be socially awkward but are very bright, she on the other hand really isn't too bright either...   I believe she has a good heart but she is so incredibly difficult to work with! I'm hoping to maybe better understand her so maybe I won't have so much disdain for her and her irritating tendencies. Some flags say possible mental disorder and she can't really help it so you can't penalize her character for that and other times I just wanna scream!   Again I'm really trying to just maybe get a better understanding!"
"hi, i really really dont know what to do. im 17 and i feel so depressed - since years. I think about suicide almost everyday and i tried to kill myself twice. Everyday i kind of break down. I cant stop crying, im close to stab a knife through my chest and my whole body phisically hurts so that I cant even sit upright. I also have to concentrate alot to not scratch my skin till it bleeds (it happend) oder wripping my hairs out. It just lasts for about 5 min but i dont know how long i can do this. I have this since years and i remember that i wanted to jump off the balcony when i was 8. Every night after the break down happens i tell i will ask for help tomorow but the next day i just play it down. This whole thing is breaking me i dont feel like im alive anymore. Does anybody has advise?  ps: sorry for mistakes im not an english speaker"
"TL:DR - girlfriend (18F) is recovering from ED and body dysmorphia, wants to lose weight and become healthy but under the supervision of a health coach.  Hi all!  My girlfriend had a serious eating disorder, body dysmorphia, and is wanting to recover badly. She has set health and weight goals for herself but wants help/guidance. Are there any fitness or health coaches who specialise or have experience with such clients?   I worked with a fitness coach several years ago and it altered my WHOLE view of fitness and diet. I learned so much in a short span. I had very mild body dysmorphia, but the approach I took whilst under a coach altered how I approached fitness. No longer did I do drastic calorie changes, workout hopping, etc. Currently she keeps taking huge measures forward and back and all over the place. She wants to have someone to trust in so she can relax and follow a program/coach who actually works. Doing it herself isn't working - so I promised to do some research into something suitable :)  I'm 21 M. The coach I had was specialised in weight training for guys, as I was looking to become bigger. She's 18 F, wanting to lose fat (5'3, 62kg). So if anybody has any resources, programmes or coaches who you'd think are ideal to get in touch with, it would be much appreciated!  Also, if there are any more suitable subreddits, please do let me know.  Thank you in advance."
"I've been on so many meds been to so many people and never improved. I don't even have a clear diagnosis.  I was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia which was a misdiagnosis. I spent years on a med I didn't even need (Risperdal). I was in a research program for it and I soon realized I didn't even have it and tried to tell people (everyone acted like I was delusional or crazy). I finally got a psychiatrist last year who discovered I didn't need it. I feel so devalued because I knew I was right all along and no one believed me. I'm probably still marked as schizophrenic on files.  People thought for sure I had Aspergers but when I went to autism testing center they concluded I didn't have it (which irritated the hell out of me because numerous people were making me believe I had it).  I've taken so many different meds and haven't seen any improvement. I don't know what's going on with me. Also I got the most anxiety provoking, embarrassing side effects on many of these meds. The antidepressants were bad. Prozac gave me bad daily diarrhea that was embarrassing as heck and gave me so much anxiety. They made me keep taking the med just to see if it would go away eventually but never did. I was miserable over it. They also tried to blame it on my diet, especially my daily coffee. I told them I didn't have this diarrhea until I started taking this med. Lexapro gave me a horrible sexual side effect and continued taking it for months until I finally said I can't take this anymore. Risperdal (the med I never even needed) gave me bad neck stiffness where my neck couldn't even move. I had to wait until I saw the doc again and he gave me a seizure med. But it was so uncomfortable and again anxiety provoking. The worst part was when I had it during group therapy and the instructor called on me. I tried to hide it and was so uncomfortable I made her skip me.  I have had bad therapists who would talk down to me and make me feel ashamed for my feelings, concerns, and fears. I never got that any of them truly got me. Little empathy really. I am leaving my current therapist because he offended me greatly.   I'm only on Adderrall for ADD(?) now. My psychiatrist doesn't know what to do with me but he's trying. I feel so discouraged.  I think I'm a bad patient and no one wants to deal with me really. Everyone always puts blame on me like I'm not letting meds work for me and I'm not even trying. My own family says these things. I feel so misunderstood and that I have nobody on my side."
"My mother is 68 years old and about 3 years ago something went wrong.   First she said that she was hearing a child in distress. No one else heard this. Not my stepfather, not her neighbors, no one. She was convinced and made great efforts to help find this kid and help her.   Next she became paranoid about electronics and started unplugging everything in the house. This turned into printing reams of Windows log files, writing down all sorts of weird numbers and names, and asking me questions about websites, security and so forth. Overall it was paranoid behavior that I could not talk her out of, and she would not acknowlege.  These led up to her having a violent incident that led to her hospitalization for two weeks. She fought the doctors and did not cooperate at all. The whole time she insisted she was not crazy. They gave a diagnosis of PTSD but that didn't really explain much to me. And considering she would not take meds, not answer questions and not go to therapy, I am assuming it was a guess.  After being released she shut out everyone. All her friends and family who live near her (I am on the west coast she is on the east coast). She still speaks to me but the conversations are short. She frequently hangs up on me.   I could go on and on, but I think the details I gave are enough.   This whole thing is heartbreaking.Before this she was the friendliest, most caring and compassionate person I've ever seen. She was kind and positive and supportive of everyone she came in contact with. Now she is furious, paranoid and resentful, and I don't know how to deal with her.  If anyone has any ideas on what may be going on or what I can do it would be greatly appreciated.  thanks"
People from the UK - what are your experiences of obtaining a mental health related diagnosis through the NHS? I've been wondering about an anxiety/maybe autism related diagnosis for a while and lately it's been getting worse. Part of my problem is that I'm very anxious about going to the GP with this (part of my fear is that they'll just tell me out of hand that there's nothing wrong and refuse to refer me or that I won't communicate properly etc etc).  I've found in the past that I'm usually more able to cope with situations that cause me anxiety if I'm able to predict them a little in advance and maybe even let them play out in my head a bit before going - would anyone be willing to describe the process to me?
"I've had several episodes of depression and psychosis since I was 16. The episode at age 16 was induced from a combination of school related stress and a relationship coming to an end. The last few episodes have been drug induced, mainly occurring when I stop smoking weed every day or most days.  My question is, if I keep seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist, take my meds and not get addicted to weed again, is it likely or possible that I won't have another episode for the rest of my life?  I've used other substances too, mainly lsd, around 40 times, but I'm looking to stop taking that. I don't want to get in trouble with the police."
"Throwaway, of course.   Okay, let me start off by saying I'm not trying to be edgy or hardcore or whatever here. I don't think what I'll describe below is 'cool'. I have no plans or intentions to end any life. I'm just a random, confused teenage girl looking for help.  I've been experiencing unusual homicidal ideation for about three years (I'm 16 now). Generally it comes in waves- sometimes I can forget about it for a month, but sometimes there will be a really intense week of it. Very rarely (3 times), there have been periods so intense that I was genuinely concerned I would hurt someone. It's been over a year since the last episode of this, though.  The thoughts revolve around killing people I like (not romantically. I also have a preferred 'type' of theoretical victim, if that's useful information), not my family, and never an animal or a child. An example: two years ago, I was sitting behind a friend in a car with a knife in my pocket. I obsessed for 45 minutes straight over cutting his throat. I'm sorry if this is too graphic, but usually they involve watching my victim's terror and eventual resignation. I think it may be a power/control thing? It's not in any way sexual.  Thing is, I enjoy these thoughts on a carnal sort of level. I'm a pretty emotional, empathetic person usually and a humanist, so on a rational level I hate that I have these thoughts, but I do enjoy them. They often pop up uninvited, but they're not exactly intrusive- it's definitely not Harm OCD. It's never been related to anything like anger or jealousy; in fact, I would hate to be so intimate (different, nonsexual intimate. I don't know how to explain this) with someone I dislike. I have been able to find exactly nothing about what this could be. I've talked to one other person (online) who has what sounds like the same thing, and they don't know either. They are on an anti-psychotic, which apparently helps with the frequency and intensity of the ideation.  As you might imagine, the first few instances of these thoughts were pretty upsetting for barely-post-pubescent me (tl;dr I thought I was a terrible person). It took a while to adjust, but I eventually learned to deal with it as a part of myself- albeit a morally abhorrent flaw and a really crappy secret. Seriously, how do you tell, say, a romantic partner about this? I know I'm ill, but I don't even know how to seek treatment once I'm out of the house. I know you can be reported for telling a therapist this kind of thing. Oh, I also don't indulge in snuff or violent images or anything, though I'd most likely enjoy them. Why look for trouble?   I do have a bit of clinical depression, but my family situation is generally fine and I've never been abused in any way. I'm otherwise a normal, fairly stable teenage girl. I don't know what the heck this is, and I was hoping someone on here might have some idea or advice. I am so sorry if this is the wrong place or I've offended/triggered someone, and I also apologize for the truly horrendous length of this post.  Any feedback is greatly appreciated."
"A very close online friend of mine has been prescribed Prozac for her depression. Unfortunately, she has been having periods where she forgets what she's been doing, what game we've been playing for the past hour, or what we talked about 30 minutes ago. Tonight, she got extremely scared and nervous about her forgetfulness.  What can I do to help her through these bouts? Can all I say is that it will be okay? I'm feeling a little lost and out of my depth here. Can anyone offer any advice?"
"Pretend you are in a small boat. And you hit a big wave. You fall out of the boat. Now most people, people without a mental illness, they would simply climb back into the boat. But for someone with a mental illness it's different. You hit the water, and unlike a normal person, your instinct isn't to get out of the water. You are more caught up with how the water feels, where it comes from, why it is there. And as you are thinking all these things you are slowly drifting down. You have no other thought on your mind but the water. And before you know it it is all you can think about. By the time you realize your falling deeper and deeper into the cold grasp of the water, it is already to late. You can see the surface, where you should be. But you are too far away. There is no way you could make it. And you might fight. You might try as hard as you can to get back to the surface, to get air that you feel like you so desperately need. But there is no point. You are so completely engulfed by the water that there is no escaping it. So you just simply fall deeper and deeper.  The water in this metaphor is the thoughts that I, like so many others with OCD, have to deal with every day. The water represents how most people, when having a thought that we do, just simply dismiss the thought and carry on. But when you have OCD it is so much harder than that. The thought becomes the only thing your mind can focus on. It becomes your sole focus. It grows and grows the more you think about it and it becomes you. By the time you realize you are falling into the feelings you know so well to be anxiety, it is already too late and the thought has total control of your mind. All you can do is sit there as the thought torments you and breaks you down over and over. No matter how hard you try to shake it."
Need some advice   I live in a smaller town with a shit hospital and on Tuesday night I attempted suicide and was taken to the hospital  They then admitted me involuntary   They then left me in an ER room for 2 days with no therapy or medication then came to me today and said Doctor:are you safe to go home  Me:I really don't think I am Doctor: well we are going to send you home and if that's what you choose to do then I can't stop you so you are going to have to learn to live with this feeling  I am not fucking lying  My councillor is writing up an official complaint   And now I don't know what to do I'm still really unsafe but it no one seems to care   I'm sorry for the rambling I'm just trying to distract myself from well myself  I requested to be transferred to another hospital they said no   And my councillor that's not associated with the hospital was told by the nurse that I am manipulating everyone and I am not sick at all  I have had documented mental illness since I was 16 and have attempted suicide 2 times 6 months ago I got very very close and was admitted to another hospital (lived somewhere else) I was there for 6 weeks and got much better for a time  I'm sorry if this is hard to understand I can't focused right now
"I was 19 years old when my grandfather was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He was my entire world. He was the only father figure/male role model I had growing up. Rather than having his family see him suffer, waste away, and die in such a terrible way, he chose to put a bullet in his brain and end his suffering. I found the body. I still remember how he looked with his head slumped over covered in his own blood with the .22 rifle leaning against his legs. Although I have never been professionally diagnosed, I know that I suffer from PTSD. I still have the nightmares, the sounds of gun shots or loud noises send me into panic attacks, and every February 10, the day he died, I spend the entire day majorly depressed and crying.  Part of me wants to seek professional help to deal with the events of that day, but after carrying around the emotional baggage for almost 20 years, I feel like the damage caused by that day have become a permanent part of my personality. What do you do when the scars from the worst day of your life become a part of who you are?"
"I've been having issues with my mental health that have been getting steadily worse for about 2 years now. I don't feel comfortable divulging all of my problems in a psychologists office - the list just goes on and on. I would *only* see a psychiatrist for one thing, which is my memory/attention/motivation. These past six months or so in particular it's just gotten so much worse, and I can't keep going on like this as a college student. I used to be able to write 15 page papers in one day, now I can't write anything anymore, and when I do it feels very forced, it doesn't flow naturally like it used to. When I have something I need to read for class, I can read a paragraph before I can't go any further, it literally feels physically painful to keep going. I have so much trouble paying attention in class, the words drift in one ear and go out the other. I feel like I've literally become stupider, that my IQ has dropped ten points since the start of this school year. I've always been pretty intelligent (only had my IQ tested once and all I know is that it was north of 130), so this has been devastating for me.   I'm getting desperate. I *don't* want to go down the long road of experimenting with various antidepressants, trying to find one that works without turning you into a zombie and dealing with all of the unpleasant side effects that go along with this trial and error period (which can sometimes last a year or more). I want something that will work *now*. Some sort of stimulant like adderall seems to be the best solution. All I ever hear about it is that it greatly improves your attention, focus, and work ethic with few negative side effects. I don't have an addictive personality and I'm committed to using it responsibly.   I'm willing to lie to get something to help with my cognitive issues. I just don't know where to start or what to say."
What is wrong with me? Nothing seems to trigger it I'll just randomly every so often be in the verge of tears and don't know why
"I feel like I am going crazy. My life feels like insanity. The longer i keep going the more I feel myself be torn apart. I am surrounded by people, but cannot talk to any of them. Nobody would listen or understand, even if they did they couldn't help me. It feels so cruel to know people are near you, but no matter how desperate you are you can never get them to understand your struggle.  I think about suicide every single day. I have no other solutions to this mess I am in. I call the Samaritans and they make me feel worse. They tell me they cannot help me because I've already made my mind up, or tell me I could speak to them all day, but nothing is going to change anything so hang up anyway. I just want someone to listen and to understand when I feel so strongly that nothing can save me. Just someone to listen to my thoughts and to get my feelings out would bring me comfort, even if suicide seems the only option it's still a relief until then.  I sit here totally isolated from the world. Nobody to call, nobody to talk to. Nobody to help me. Nothing anyone says brings me any comfort because they're just empty words. People say it'll get better, HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.  I am going to die because I can't live like this much longer. I can't cope with this ridiculous mess my life turned out to be. I live without reason, without love and without connections with people. It's beginning to feel too painful too just exist. I want to end it all. Not because i want to die, but because there is NOTHING I can do to change myself or to sort out my shattered and hopeless life.  My therapist says that I am articulate. That I am attractive, funny, intelligent. That I have so much to give to the world. That she enjoys my company blah blah. I can't help but feel she could look at a serial killer and still find nice words to say about them. I cannot accept anything she's saying to me. I don't believe a damn thing. It tears me apart thinking she's sitting there lying to my face. It makes me hurt even more that she actually thinks I believe her. She clearly doesn't know me or understand me and she is the only person who should."
Develop very intense crushes and then have the tendency to stalk/cyberstalk men (even after I've been rejected several times. How do I refocus my attention on to something healthier?
"So this is my first time posting in here and I have a question that I was hoping someone could shed light on. So I was diagnosed with panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and general anxiety disorder a few years ago. I started on Zoloft originally but it actually made my anxiety much worse, causing me to go into mental states where I could not focus, with feelings of displacement and extreme panic. Anyway, after that I went into citalopram. It has greatly improved my anxiety. I don't have panic attacks very often (unless something is very emotionally stimulating), but I still have a constant (but stable) panic in the back of my head. However, I've been going through depressive episodes more frequently over the last year or so followed by panic and then back to depression. So to my point, I've seen many psychiatrists and therapists. One of them said it was possible I was bipolar, but we were not compatible so I never saw her again. And now I'm thinking, is it possible that I could have it? I wouldn't think it's as severe as some people I know, but is it possible I have a mild case?  Edit: I also was diagnosed with body dysmorphia, but it is reasonably controlled (I do not act on my intrusive thoughts and can get rid of them pretty quick)"
"I just got an undergrad degree last year, and graduated with a low ~2.5 GPA. To remedy this, I've been trying to take a licensing exam to compensate for it.   The main problem is that I live with very angry parents. My dad works all day and comes home very angry and hopeless. He makes very loud noises while taking the stairs, closing doors, getting dishes to eat, etc. He's also sick, has high blood pressure/diabetes, and has had a very puffy face since the last year or so.   My mother never attempts to remove the junk that she's allowed to accumulate in our house. She also despises my father, and has never shown any sort of sympathy or affection toward him in the last 5 years. Parents sleep in separate beds.   During my last semester of college, I had what you'd consider a social life--multiple groups of friends, activities, and lots of motivation. I was away from my parents during this time. The world seemed very hopeful.   After coming back home, most of my former buddies have made little contact with me. Recently, some have made contact, but I'm always so anxious to respond because I'm a fucking 25 year old NEET and I feel terrible about making small talk about what I've done over the past several months. Either I'm gonna have to make up a lie, or admit the truth, which is that I've done nearly nothing.   I also have zero social life--I don't own a car. I try to talk to people on the internet.   I guess I'd like some advice on what to do, sort of venting here. The fact that I have almost zero social life, AND spend my life around parents who hate each other 24/7, is extremely stressful, and it's honestly depriving me of the mental resources needed to pass this exam.   A lot of this situation is my fault as well."
"So it's midnight, I was sat listening to Roo Panes, crying. For no reason at all. His music's genuinely so emotive, but I canâ€™t handle how good it is, I find myself going back and listening to a whole other album. Although, my mascara-stained cheeks and red blotchy face can't just be for nothing, I feel like there must be a psychological reason as to why Panes' music is triggering endless tears and streams of snot. Am I just being a hormonal teenage girl? Or am I breaking down? I just found it difficult to breath or stop wrenching my body and puffing in large volumes of air for about an hour. Iâ€™ve never felt so overwhelmed. I started to question my blubbering and thought about what was happening. I felt personal thoughts, ones about my gran's health condition, flood into my head, how this affected my mum and the strain it was causing her. I'm a student nurse and I've only had experience caring for elderly, so I've picked up a few lessons along the way, things which I know relate to my gran's current health status - but I'd rather not share with my family over it causing endless worry. Which brings me to my next point, I'm a worrier. I worry about situations, people and things that often don't affect me. I worry about my gran. I worry about my mum, she's everyone's rock and go-to for advice. I worry about my boyfriend feeling isolated in his flat at university, like if I could drive already to just be there at any time it'd help him, and me, a great deal.  Tonight, I thought to myself, I donâ€™t have any of my close friends around â€“ theyâ€™re either at uni, busy or bail on plans. My closest friend has a life in a distant town, I canâ€™t just call her to pop down to my house and hang out. I had a realisation that I canâ€™t do that with anyone. I felt isolated. In my own home, where my dad is in the next room. When Iâ€™m with my boyfriend, everything is perfect, but I canâ€™t see him all the time. So between the two weeks of seeing each other, thereâ€™s no friends readily available to turn to and meet up with, theyâ€™re schedules are all fully booked. I panicked and had to take deep breaths, I donâ€™t know why I was so overwhelmed. I think feeling that way was selfish, because I have my family here and I live in their company. I just usually turned to my friends when we were in high school to share my problems. I donâ€™t want to always discuss my granâ€™s case with my boyfriend because he probably has his own problems to worry about. Even though he is my rock, I donâ€™t like being a burden to people or come across as looking for sympathy, talking about things to get them out of my head is what helps me.  I guess a build-up of all these thoughts tonight didn't prove mentally fitting and so forced me to cry until there was nothing left.  Iâ€™m sorry if this dampened anyoneâ€™s night, I just had to get that all out haha. If anyone has experienced something like this though, could you please tell me why it happens? I'm probably just being silly."
"It happens all the time where I'll be feeling moody and anxious all day, but I can't figure out why. Then at the end of the day I open my pill organizer and I see all the meds I forgot to take the night before. Like oh right, well then, that would explain quite a bit."
"It's my birthday tomorrow, like again a year ago I feel like I should be dead... I won't attempt though last year around this time I did twice. I'm turning 17. I mean the only thing I was looking forward to was a new computer or laptop, mum said she would get me one, yet now she's saying she hasn't gotten anything. Oh well I probably deserve nothing but my MacBook is dying so ðŸ˜–. I wanna cut again....  oh well"
"I've suffered from depression for years. I often find myself in deep thought about the life I've lived so far. What's the point to it all? I've come across this question like so many others before, so many times. My beliefs have shifted greatly over the years. From being a god fearing man, to learning the soul crushing truth. There is no god. Man made religion for the weak minded to help cope with the stress from the unanswered questions in life. As for the all the unexplained and unnatural. There's always a scientific explanation to it. After all, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. There's a type of depression called depressive realism. It means that people with depression, could actually be perceiving the world as it actually is. I suppose that's why I can handle stressful situations for then others. I've acknowledged that I have very little control over anything in this world. Even my own thoughts or actions. It's all based off of emotions. Emotions are just chemical reactions in the brain that can be easily changed."
"ok title was little harsh and possibly click bait. i didnt mean that i feel self entitled to everything and like a kid i act out when i dont get what i want. What i meant rather is that i hate it when i plan ahead and prepare for a certain outcome, only to be screwed over when things dont come my way. It seems my high expectations dont meet reality and my fucking brain OCD's to the point where I  feel like i've been wronged and that feeling lasts throughout the rest of the day.  How can i control my emotions so that logic prevails and tells my brain to grow the fuck up. My emotions just wont keep up with the logical part of my thinking.  This doesnt happen often of course, but i want to be able to handle it better, and not be moody, or passive aggresive to people i feel attributed to this"
"Hi, everybody. Okay so this subreddit is the only place I can think of to ask... *What* is going on with these Flat-Earthers? It seems this movement is picking up a *lot* of momentum recently, and one thing I can see in common with all the proponents is that they are very unstable people. It makes me think there is some kind of mental illness which is causing this delusional belief system along with its associated antisocial behaviors.  The gist of it is that yes, the flat-earth belief system is alive and well, and they totally believe it despite the obvious and overwhelming evidence to the contrary. As a curiosity, if you actually engage one of them in a discussion about the topic, they can't articulate their position with any kind of facts, logic, reason, or evidence. They also are quite condescending and immature when they talk to you. It's almost like some kind of cult. But what's really weird is that if you try to research *the phenomenon* on the internet, your search results are mostly material *by* the FE people trying to get new believers. The ratio of insanity to sanity here is quite low, surprisingly.  Mostly, I'm really wanting to know if anyone here has any insight into the mental health problems that are involved in making these people behave this way.  Thanks"

"I'm 41 and have a brother who is four years older. He's been a constant source of stress and anxiety for me my entire life. When we were just little kids, he would intentionally scare me by telling me our parents weren't coming back if they went out or banging on the door and harassing me when I was in the bathroom. Small things, but they build up.  When he was in his early teens, he would relentlessly bully me to the point I was in fear of coming home when he was around. He would hit me and call me names (faggot, homo, etc). My friends were afraid of him, too. He would mock everything I did. I guess I kind of thought that was what older siblings did - it seemed horrible, but normal. My parents would tell him to stop but he wouldn't. I basically never felt safe at home with him around.  In his mid-teens, he began drinking and doing drugs (which was good for me because he'd be gone more, hanging out with loser friends and I could be alone more often). In his later teens/early 20s, he developed some sort of mental illness which has been diagnosed as either major depressive disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Again, life became hell due to his condition. Except this was extra confusing - I hated him for how he had treated me my whole life and for ruining our family's chances at a peaceful household, but also felt guilty because he was in such an awful, painful condition. Even though I was terrified he would kill himself (as he often talked about), I sometimes hoped he would die just so my parents and I could get some relief from him. This thought made me feel guilty as well.  The past twenty years haven't been much easier, though he has improved with therapy and medication. However, he is incredibly needy. He calls my mother daily and I daily (though I often don't pick up anymore) to complain about everything and anything. He treats us like we're therapists, spilling every little detail of every perceived slight against him. He tries to make me feel guilty by proposing that I have this great life (I really don't - I struggle, too).  An example from today: He called me this morning and I didn't pick up. I had already talked to him last night (he was actually in a decent mood then). He left a message: I know you're busy with your job and girlfriend and other work and your friends, but I need to talk. I'm really upset with (his friend). Call me. That sort of thing doesn't make me want to call him back. He's saying that I'm too busy to talk to him, when really, I just don't have the mental energy to be a sounding board for his daily complaints. I'm just depleted. For the past five years, I've heard his every complaint about his girlfriend (which is a nightmare situation usually), her kids, her dog, his jobs (which he doesn't stick with). It's too much. It's not that I don't have time - I just feel like I die a little every time I have to devote my energy to talking to him about his problems.  A few months ago, after another terrible argument with his girlfriend, my brother drove to a spot in the woods and took a whole bunch of pills. He then called me crying. I made him go to the hospital and stayed with him on the phone. He was then admitted to a mental hospital for a week. I had hoped he and his girlfriend would finally break up, but they got back together when he got out.  Besides, he doesn't take any of the advice that my mother and I give him for ways to feel better: go for a walk, meditate, paint/draw, watch a funny movie, etc.  Why don't I tell him that I can't take it anymore instead of just dodging his calls? I have. But then he gets angry *at me* and hangs up.  He makes my mother cry often and it kills me. She is in her 70s and is having a very hard time with health and money issues, but instead of helping, he continues to be overly needy, and gets angry when she doesn't have time or energy to deal with him.  How has a lifetime of having a mentally ill sibling effected me? I'm prone to high anxiety and depression. My relationships suffer because I have a hard time getting close to and feeling comfortable around people. I feel constant guilt and shame. I drank heavily for several years because that was the only way I could feel relief. Who can say if I would be this way anyway? But I imagine how I might've been had I not been tortured by this person my entire life. Maybe I would've turned out the same, I don't know.  I'm so jealous of people who have normal, functional siblings. I wish I had a brother who helped me out when I was younger instead of constantly putting me down and hitting me. I wish I had someone I could call for advice when I was upset instead of someone calling me every day to tell me how terrible life is.  Outside of cutting him out of my life, I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I do need to tell him I can't stand the calls and messages anymore, and just deal with him being angry. I feel afraid that if I do try to make some boundaries, he'll hurt himself.  Thank you if you read all of that. I needed to get it off my chest.  **TL;DR: My mentally ill brother has been a constant source of strife and tension my entire life.**  Do you have a mentally ill sibling? How has their behavior effected you? I would like to hear your story because I feel so alone in all of this."
"(I posted this on the concussion reddit, too, but for good measure i thought it may be appropriate to post here, too)   So I sustained a concussion in 2011 after falling off my bike. I remember seeing stars when I stood back up, and feeling.. angry for no real reason. I remember thinking it was weird, but I moved on. I didn't immediately go to the hospital because I assumed I was fine cause I didn't pass out or anything. But, after feeling off for a while I decided to go to the hospital 2 days later at the advice of my friend.  I had probably typical symptoms. Headaches, light sensitivity, fatigue, mild stutter/slur. I also struggled in school keeping focus/eye contact, and when I was writing notes I couldn't keep up with the professor and was writing down the wrong words/letters, sometimes backwards. I got really frustrated. When the accident happened I had been messaging my friend back and forth on facebook, and one thing that I found interesting was, right after the accident, I developed new typos that don't exist anywhere in my earlier chat history with him. I sometimes still do have these identical kind of typos.  i have a cloth sack sort of thing, but i was onm y way down tog et it. i wasnt carrying anything.  Yeah, I'm goign to mention it tot hem monday. It's not teh first time someone fell.  So, after a few months I was pretty much fully recovered. I do still type sloppily and experience those same kinds of typos. But not quite as bad. But one thing I had then and now was, when I get really angry, I feel this weird twitch inside my head, and my head jerks to the right very subtly. Or, I just feel an urge to jerk my head like that when I feel that quick twitch inside my head. It doesn't hurt. It's just a weird sensation.  This is only when I'm really angry. No other times. Why does this happen? I can't find any information on it anywhere."
"Deactivated all my social media except Reddit. Seeing people's lives progress and move on while mine is moving backwards was too much for me. My friends are gone, why involve family and my husband and I are on a rocky platform.  So I'm shutting it all out."
"Hi, for about four years I've been slowly losing general 'motivation' for everything. These last 6 months I've been sleeping for 12 to 14 hours a day and spending almost every waking moment feeling drained both physically and mentally. I always thought it would go away but a few days ago I hit the critical point and decided to schedule a meeting with a doctor and some counseling through my university.  The problem is that I'm no good at explaining how I feel. It's not that I can't make smalltalk and socially interact I'm just really bad at describing emotions, which is the main problem because I know it's all in my head. I figured that since I'll be visiting people to try and sort myself out in the next few days I'd try and get some answers and explanations pre-prepared for common questions during a first meeting.  So basically what kind of questions am I supposed to expect when visiting a counsellor and doctor for mental issues for the first time? Any replies are much appreciated."
"Whenever I get stressed I tend to have sexual thoughts. Some times it lasts for for a few minutes other times it can last the whole day. It either happens randomly or about the time I get out of school, which is around 3."
"I'm a 21 year old girl and my bf is 22 years old. We've almost been dating for a year, and it's been great. However, my boyfriend shows signs of mental illness. He has confided with me that he has been diagnosed with depression, and he has anger and emotional issues (which stem from a long bad history with his family who are all pieces of shit, but that's a long story). He knows he feels like this sometimes, but when we fight about things, his 'side' of the arguments are not coming from a place of logic, and while they make sense to him, everyone else around him sees that it is an unhealthy way to deal with those problems. He's very alone right now, has little money and is in a bad place, because we've been arguing on and off every other day for almost a week. I worry and care about him, and my friends (as well as his) agree that he is not mentally well. How do I tell him this though without sounding rude? Because we keep trying to fix our relationship, but you can't make a relationship work if he is mentally and emotionally hurting, because the relationship will just fall back into old habits. I've been contemplating ending the relationship, because it is negatively affecting me and my feelings and we just aren't on the same level in our lives, but that's hard because: 1-I love him and don't want to give up and 2-I worry that if I do end it that will just make him spiral out even more and worse and he is going to end up hurting himself (he has been suicidal in his past, not since i've known him) and I would feel horrible because I feel like it's my fault that this is happening when i'm only ever trying to help us, and all his life he's used to people abandoning him. The one thing I know for sure is that our relationship isn't healthy and isn't working with what we're doing right now. He's emotionally manipulative, but I feel like he doesn't actually realize what he's doing, he's not doing it maliciously.  So I guess, my question is, how can I bring these things up to him without him getting angry and upset? I don't think you can just tell someone 'I feel like you are mentally unstable' because if he can't see that about himself, me telling him that would just end up being me criticizing him and not respecting his feelings. I just worry because he's in a bad place right now, and it feels like anything i try to do to make it better sets him off, and if I leave that would send him over the edge."
"I'm so frustrated right now trying to study for some financial licensing exams. It's not like I don't understand the materials, I do. But I just CANNOT focus and I really really need to be studying and making progress. And I'm just not. I'm really frustrated and upset with myself, I feel like I've tried so many other ways of studying to engage my brain and nothing is working. I don't know what to do and I feel so stuck and stupid. Idk. I just needed to vent."
I have MDD and I literally just felt my depressive episode start a few minutes ago. I hurt all over and feel so much sorrow it's unbearable. But I'm in college and I really need to maintain motivation. Any tips?
"So let me begin by saying that I know I sound absolutely ridiculous and self-absorbed and even petty by struggling with this. However, let me explain.   I have struggled with extreme depression and anxiety for my entire life. Even as a young child, even though I didn't know what was technically going on with me, I struggled.   When I started college, I had my first full blown manic episode. I was diagnosed Bipolar I, and at that point, the seemingly never-ending line of medications began. I had horrible side effects to any of the ones that helped in any way. I had become adjusted to the idea that I would never know life without depression.  About six months ago I heard about TMS treatment and decided to give it a shot. It ended up working better for me than I could have imagined, and I was thrilled.   I have been not depressed for the first time in my life which has been great, but I am quickly realizing that I don't know *how* to not be depressed or incredibly. I'm not sure if this will make sense to anyone else, but I had spent my entire life adjusting to surviving amidst the anxiety and depression.   Has anyone else been through this?   I'm very thankful that the treatment worked, but I honestly feel more lost and alone than ever. I had a lot of books on how to try and cope with the depression and anxiety, but I have no idea what to do from here.   How do I learn to think/feel without the anxiety and depression?"
"Okay, so the highlights of my younger life are in the title. I'll elaborate in a moment. But the real issue is that I have no clue how to interact with my peers. I am so socially inept that even adults have resorted to the same pranks and hurtful comments that my peers made towards me when I was in school growing up. I just turned 40 in November, and have only fully accepted my sexuality for a few years. But a successful relationship seems absolutely impossible for me, and sometimes the sadness seems like too much to handle.  Here's the details: I was born in 76. When my mother was pregnant, she was extremely ill and near death for various reasons. When I was born I immediately exhibited problems seeing and hearing. I never responded to people, other than by touch. In addition to that, I was constantly sick. I was in and out of the hospital a lot as a child.  My mother's illnesses and my own limitations and illnesses were too much for my father, so he left when I was five and moved all the way to the other side of the country. I later learned that he had a relationship with a girl (16 years younger than him) while still married to my mother. That girl moved down there soon after my parents divorced and they immediately got married. I never saw him, except for a few weeks during the summer each year. I also later learned that he never had to pay child support either, because he and my mother were in a business together at the time. He just gave her his half of the business. Easy out.  About a year later, my mother remarried. This man terrorized my entire childhood until I ran away at age 16. Believe it or not, I eventually ended up living with my father and step-mother. As hurt as I was by my father, he was at least better than living with my step-father and weak mother. He physically beat me and emotionally tormented me to the point that I left adolescence without a shred of confidence.  My health conditions improved. I had several surgeries on my eyes and ears, and was constantly in and out of doctors' offices and hospitals, but I eventually improved dramatically during and after puberty. During my teens, my eyesight continued to improve dramatically and my hearing, although still is far from perfect, improved enough to function adequately. But the damage was done pretty early on. During my younger, developmental years I was alone and never interacted with boys my age. During elementary school, as things started to improve with my vision and hearing, I was able to talk with my peers, but I struggled with the social rules and interacting especially with boys my age. They perplexed me. I seemed so weak and fragile physically and emotionally compared to them. And, as you can imagine, that made me an easy target. And I got it pretty bad at times. I mostly learned to hide really well. I lived in the shadows as best I could.  I developed crushes for my male peers pretty early on. Early sexual experiences with other boys, mostly on the order of experimentation, only further fueled the flame of my desires for male companionship and relationship, and as I eventually learned, sexual contact.  BUT....before you start freaking out about all of that.....by the time I was a very young teen boy, I had everything under control. How? Because by that time I was already thoroughly enmeshed in the Mormon culture. I apologize if you are sympathetic to the Mormon religion, but I have recently left it and see things SO much clearer now. Back when I was growing up in the Mormon church, I was taught self-loathing, self-hate, unbelievable guilt and denial of my own sexuality.  Because I was dealing with constant abuse, emotional and physical turmoil by my peers at school, religious indoctrination and health issues, I never acted out on my feelings for other males. I never experienced the enjoyment of connecting with a true crush during these important years.  Later on, I eventually went on a mission for the Mormon church, experimented with a few male companions during those few years, but returned determined to make everyone else in my life happy and pleased with me. So, I dated girls for a long time. Several years. It was miserable. I never connected with anyone. It was impossible for me. During this time, me being gay was beginning to be much more clear to me. I eventually came out to my family when I was 25. They loved me, but treated it as a disease that had to be attacked and cured. I went through years of therapy designed to change my sexual orientation. Never happened. But, still determined to please everyone else except myself, I finally ran into a woman who made it extremely easy for me to date. She, as I later learned, was emotionally damaged and needy. She made it obvious to me that she liked me and wanted to have a relationship with me. (As a side-note, reading social cues was nearly impossible for me, so understanding when a girl liked me was crazy impossible for me. So, when she just right away told me, it was easy.) We got married after dating for only 4 months.  Fast-forward to 2015. I have three daughters. I am again going through tremendous emotional abuse, this time from my wife, who it turns out is bipolar and has borderline personality disorder. After going through all of this and having been gas-lighted by her during my entire 13 year marriage, I file for divorce. I was literally choosing between killing myself or leaving. I know that my wife would never do anything to hurt our children. And my children would be able to get to know me SO much better outside of that unhealthy marriage. I would be a much better father to them in a better environment without their mother.  Now, 20 months later, I am officially divorced. My children are doing SO much better. Our relationship is amazing. They have really been able to experience life with an attentive, loving father now. They will be fine, although I am not oblivious to their problems that they will have later on because of the divorce.  But, naturally, I am wanting so badly to have a relationship. As a gay man, I yearn and crave the attention of another man. But, it is something that has almost never happened for me. And I worry that it never will. Here is why:  1) Although I have quit the Mormon church, I live with the effects of having lived in that cult-like environment still. I deal with self-loathing and internalized homophobia on a daily basis.  2) I do not know how to interact normally, still, with men (gay or straight). I come across as stand-offish, shy, scared and without any confidence. I want so badly to correct this. But I have no context of understanding for how to deal with this issue, as it has defined my entire life.  3) Sexually, I am attracted to men. Emotionally, though, I am attracted to women. I can connect with them in ways that I never can with a man. I understand that this is a common thing for many gay men. But, not having been in a gay relationship of any depth, I cannot fathom how to emotionally connect with a man.  **Oh my God, people. I can't believe how long this is! I so appreciate you reading this if you got this far. You are a generous soul. Thank you. Any pertinent comments, suggestions and help are more than appreciated.**"
"I have a brother who is driving my family crazy.   He thinks everyone is trying too poison him or kill him in some way. He stayed at my mom's house the other night and induced vomiting at least three times because he thought she might be trying to poison him.   He is currently homeless and can't seem to keep a job for more than a few weeks.  His ten year girlfriend recently broke up with him because he had a history of being verbally and physically abusive.   Not only is he stressing out my family, but given his history, I am worried for all of our physical safety. I have been triple-locking my doors and checking my windows every day to make sure they're locked.  He does have anger issues, some particularly at me.   I have a wife and kid and am concerned that he might try to harm someone out of desperation.   We've tried giving him contact information for homeless shelters and counseling services, but he never goes through with anything.   My mom's blood pressure is 150/91 because she is always stressed out.   Is there any way to force him into a psychiatric hospital?   I know it sounds horrible, but I'm seriously thinking about getting my FOID card, a handgun, and a security system to protect my house.  I'm probably over-thinking some of it, but I don't feel safe around him. And I don't think anyone else does either.  For legal advice (not professional or official, I know), I live in Illinois."

"Hi, I'm starting a new blog about mental illness (aboutmentalillnessblog.wordpress.com), and I want to feature stories from people with mental illness, and am looking for interviews. This isn't for profit or school, I just think it's important that people talk more about mental health.

These posts would be anonymous, and I would only post them after they were reviewed by my interviewee. I would also not use the interview material for anything else."
"So yeah, what exactly is melancholia? I know the meaning has changed a lot probably since the days of Hippocrates and his humor-ism...BUT what is it, in an objective(or as close to it) sense. The DSM talks about melancholia being a type of depression or having depression *with* melancholic features. BUT ive scoured the web and couldn't find anything that really clearly stated the difference of melancholia and depression. Opinions, facts, interpretations, etc. are all welcome, but just lemme know which angle you're coming from with your answer! Thanks, in advanced."
"Hi. I'm a 23 year old male who lives alone at college. I suffer and am medicated for anxiety and major depression. Sometimes if I'm really late taking my depression medicine it'll make me feel really sick after I do take it. Such as electric shocks in my head and really hallucination type nightmares. As you can imagine this is really stressful when I'm dealing with it. Also there are times when I'm upset or freaking out about something and it's difficult for me to relax and think logically. I've used suicide hotlines in the past when I was suicidal but I was wondering if there's any resources for me to contact someone during these less urgent episodes. Obviously my life isn't on the line, i just have difficulty dealing with them. Anything y'all can suggest? Even if it's not a hotline, if it's just something you do that helps you relax and cope. I'm still working on my coping techniques with my therapist"
"Hi, I have always been the type of person we is doing 5 things at once and constantly tapping my feet and pacing in the room. I feel the need for constant stimulation. Recently it has started to effect my relationship and I'm looking for options. Is this something I should speak to a PCP about? Or is this just normal behavior? Sorry if I'm in the wrong place."
"This is going to take some explaining so bear with me. I'm not sure whether it's psychological or neurological, rooted in PTSD or possible BPD but I am exploring all those avenues currently to try and sort it out.    To boil it down, I'm not feeling emotion properly. It's all across the board, positive and negative. I'm not completely detached (I am aware of how my mind is 'trying' to feel) but none of them truly connect. I get the message you are currently happy/annoyed/sad (not all at once), please act accordingly but the feelings are very blunted. I have had significant traumas in my life (home invasions, death of family and friends including finding my Dad's body in his flat after he committed suicide, numerous instances of child sexual abuse and more as an adult) but I have come a long way since. I have a lot to show for my life. I can feel the vague semblance of happiness (and the other emotions) and the cues are there to how I ought to be feeling, it just fails to fully materialize and completely register as an emotion. I essentially am the person I've wanted to be, but it doesn't feel as meaningful as it should.    My girlfriend fortunately is very understanding of this, she knows I love her, I know I do so she doesn't take it personally or assume I'm being cold and so on. It's getting very frustrating and intrusive. I haven't cried on over a year. Not even when my close friend died this New Years. Unlike all the other psychological problems and shortcomings I had in my life, this has just stumped me. I'm trying and continue to try just about everything but I don't know where to go from here. In the meantime, I am at least keeping the seat warm, continuing down the road I assume I would be if I didn't have this problem under the assumption that I'll feel normal again eventually and won't have wasted any time. I would appreciate any insight into what is going on here."
"Okay so ever since I was 12 or 13 (I'm 24 now) I sometimes get a weird sensation, like everything is a dream and nothing is real and everything is so boring and mundane that I just want to die. It usually lasts for 5-10 seconds then it just ends and I continue on with my life lol. It happens at any moment, whether I'm at home and bored or am having the time of my life, it hits and I feel like I'm in a dream and I just want to die. I'm not depressed but I don't know what this sensation occurs (around once a week). It's not like I think it or or have control of it, it's like I'm suddenly pulled away from my mind and everything's not real??"
"Straight to the point:  When anxiety hits hard, most times I turn into a damn animal.   Last night I ended up going to my Ex's house (our house) to pick up all the things I left there to help her, because she had posted something online about me that she didn't think I would see, then when I asked her about it she blocked me from all communications. Ended up being more like a fucked up angry mental breakdown. I actually applaud myself for keeping my cool as well as I did, even after getting spit in my face.   Is this like an anger issue, or what? I *really* need to get this fixed."
"So, I'm 18 years old. I've had this, like, kinda small, wool? blanket ever since I was small, and in my early teen years I've become attached to it. I often put the cool side up to my face, and it conforts me. I also hold on to it when I sleep. I think this might be really weird, and I don't know what to do about it since I'm going to be starting college in the fall. I can't be in college and have a blanket like this, but I can't bear to be apart from it. Also, I still sleep with stuffed animals. That's also a problem, but I'm just mostly concerned about the blanket thing I guess. I don't think it's normal with people my age, right?"
"I have seen psychiatrists, psychologists for years. None have helped. I live with my boyfriend of 10 years and we are both unhappy. He has an issue to talk about, I think how he feels and what he says is unfair and wrong. Eventually, I get frustrated with his refusal to see anything differently and get very upset.   DBT, CBT, Mindfulness, nothing works.  Please help me. I'm ruining my life and am about to lose everything but even that doesn't stop me."
How come after doing the course I still feel depressed and anxious and no different from before?  Isn't this a mental health treatment? I feel really agitated that I didn't see improvement.   If this doesn't work then what will? Im concerned there are no options at this point.
"I am having some issues, most of which I would say are anger/impulse/trust issues, and many others to fall in between. If anyone has ever had a good or bad experience with EFT, how did it go? Did it help even though you were skeptical?"
"Looking for some books to help myself. Ebook preferred, if possible. So: Any books people can recommend for Anorexia Nervosa? Any books people can recommend to start practicing Mindfulness?"
"Hi my fellow redditors! Hope y'all doing fine. I'm a 18 year old.  Well, despite my financial situation, problems, difficulties, desires... I live happy. I'm an introvert which likes to socialize with people, whose future and goals are like mine. Sadly, I've got no one this type to socialize. I beat major depression few years ago, panic disorder, anxiety disorder (without medications or therapies).  Lately, I feel that I'm hypervigilant, being exposed to 3-4 traumas last 3 years, which is obviously logical, it bothers a little bit though.  Anyway, long story short: I like to exploit people for my personal benefits. I feel a little bit guilty, but not that much, it doesn't matter. Manipulate with them, manipulate with everyone just to get what I need, and, it worked and it's working. Those who are affected, only like 0.1% of them knew what I did, except this percentage, everyone thinks it's okay. It's not something that I can really get caught, I thought a lot about it.  I am aware that without appropriate tests and mental health specialists, I can't be diagnosed but I just want opinions. I know this is lack of empathy and it's not OK for third party. And, it's like you get used to it, you crave for it because it brings pleasure. Perhaps dopamine?  Am I okay (even though I feel so) or I'm not? What do you think?  One love! &lt;3"

I decided to stop seeing my psychiatrist because every fucking time I saw her, I could tell that she just wanted me to die. Obviously, she's programmed to have to say otherwise, but it's really fucking obvious. She knew I had nothing wrong with me and that I'm just fucking evil, and was angry with me for wasting her time.  I've lost all of my friends due to my behavior and constant severe mood swings caused by me being evil, and I know that I can't ever make new friends because I have to essentially seclude myself from society due to the fact that I am evil.  I'm stuck alone, scared, and wanting to die and I know that everyone else wants me to die too. There is no help for me, since there is nothing actually wrong with me on a mental health level and no medication or therapy can cure evil."
"I thought my problem was lack of critical thinking skills. Now I realize my brain can't even have complete and relevant thought processes at the bare minimum. When I converse with someone, I seem to have no reaction - no thought or emotion whatsoever - to what they are saying. I thought I just had to develop critical thinking skills by doing well in school, but it seems that I can't even contribute to discussions or elaborate on essay topics or be able to question and analyze simple information. I'm at a loss. This is affecting both my academics and my social life. Any advice? :("
"Update: Thank you, everyone. Very helpful stuff"
"Since about 7 years old, I've seen creatures and monsters staring at me in my peripheral vision, sometimes even in my direct vision when at dusk in the bushes in my backyard. I know their not real, but sometimes I feel them looking at me and I feel very paranoid. They don't talk to me or interact with me except for looking at me and sometimes coming close, but they've never come closer than 5 feet. Please someone help me figure out whats wrong with me, people said I have a very imaginative brain but I don't know anymore."
"I am diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type and in therapy. I finally opened up today about past traumas real or imagined. And he said that he saw me in three parts. The normal (me, trying to hold it all together), the rage (brian), and the confused (doesn't really have a name because of how twisted it is.) with a scared little boy at the center. Does he mean dissociative identity disorder, or something else? He kept thanking the 'inner me's' for allowing me to express what I have bottled up since I was young.  I just remember the end of the session feeling all twisted inside, like snakes were curling around in my chest.  He also said he wants to see me as often as possible (whether because medicare pays for it (I am on disability), or he realizes I am in need of help). I see him again tomorrow.  I've been in therapy since 2011, but it was with a low cost clinic and an LCSW. I never really felt connected to her because the therapy seemed to be on rails dictated by what the low income insurance would cover. This new psychologist actually takes the time to listen to what is going on and seems to understand what is inside me."
I have know since I was little (I am now 22) that I have bipolar tendencies. However recently they have been a lot worse I feel I should go see a doctor but last time I tried seeing a doctor(about 2 years ago he said he would want to go over my childhood. I don't remember most of my child just some bad things. I don't know what might come out of digging past a memory block or how it would effect my current situation. Any help would be appreciated.

"What's your story? How'd it happen, and how'd you find out it was wrong?   Or have any of you ever had different doctors disagree on diagnoses? That's where I'm at now. Which probably means someone's wrong.   It's frustrating. I think doctors do try their best, but even good doctors make mistakes.   But I want to hear your stories. What were you diagnosed with, and what did it turn out to actually be?"
"Fuck. It's nearly 6 am and I'm so so damn uncomfortable. The way she was mean to me and my friend was so real. I'm laying in bed now next to my partner, and I know they'll protect me and I know I feel safe with them. And so I am sort of safe, I'm safe with them. But I can't shake the memories and feelings of past nightmares where I've been shit scared because of her, my dreams feel so real and i hate it, I hate it so much.  Its an hour till my partner has to get up for school so i don't want to wake them up, but as soon as I woke up and realised it was a dream I wanted to hear their voice so I could know that reality wasn't a dream.   How do i even deal with this? I've been to /r/raisedbynarcissists and frequent there so I know what issues mom and dad have in that sense and what sort of things they've given me (of mental health issues) and I've been to therapy like 11 times but I couldn't afford it and I didn't like the therapist. I'm going to talk to someone the 31st of Jan about my recent anxiety issues, but I can't decide on what's more important to figure out or talk about (anxiety and life vs past with parents). Was my childhood bad? Was my mom so mean that I should speak to a professional? I dont know, I can't decide for myself if its important enough, if I'm not just making it seem like it was worse than it is or was.   I just had to get this off my chest. If anyone can offer any sort of advice or kind words, I'll welcome it all. &lt;3"
"I've known my friend (we'll call him Joe) since 2006. We were very close friends in high school, ended up going to college together and even both landed jobs close enough that we now live together in a house of 4. Joe has always had an addictive personality and has gone through periods of substance abuse. He's been a chain smoker and binge drinker since 13 due to being from a foreign country. During college he was constantly smoking weed, took a good amount of shrooms and even more acid, but the worst stint was the adderall and whatever similar amphetamines he could get his hands on. Joe majored in a very difficult STEM major and was constantly stressed about school and went to extreme lengths to take the edge off and get an advantage mentally.  His dad is very successful in the same field that Joe is currently in. Growing up he would always talk about how talented his dad is and it became very obvious that he was obsessed with surpassing his their field. By obsessed I mean science was all he talked about in college, even at parties he would just ramble on about famous people in his field and new things he learned about.  Over time things got more political and paranoia started creeping in. He would sometimes ramble about how fucked up America is, that we should be a socialist country, how the rich are fucking everyone. Eventually it turned into fuck the FBI and the FBI are watching me. He would cherry pick strange encounters and dwell on them for months thinking that people were out to get him or watching him. He's terrified that he's being targeted because of his views on America. I will ask him specifically why he think people are watching him and he never directly answers my questions and his stories are always varying.  For the past months he's been incredibly distant from me. He won't say more than a word to me. Finally tonight he asked to speak to me outside. He started with saying I'm going to record this conversation and said that he wanted to end our friendship because I've been lying to him (I haven't been). I asked him maybe 10 times what I've been lying to him about and he keeps skirting the answer and finally saying I can't tell you because it would be incriminating. I asked if he thinks that I've been giving information to people about him and I could tell that's what he thinks without him actually saying it.   Although he still drinks, smokes cigarettes, and gets his stimulant from massive amounts of coffee he's been clean from drugs for over a year. Has anyone experienced anything like this? My guess is that the paranoia is triggered from Adderall abuse. I know he claimed to have taken 600 mg in one day. This is ridiculous that he wants to throw away a 10 year friendship over nothing. He said his plan is to get his PhD and move to Denmark where he can trust people more."
"Hello! First, I am not a mental health professional. I think the answer to this question is lol, no. Oh, you're serious. Dude, no. And then there's my mother, the mental health professional.   **Long background behind my query:**  I have Autism that wasn't diagnosed until my late 20s. I'm an articulate female so I skirted under the radar. I *do* have communication issues though. If someone doesn't speak somewhat literally or factually I can't really follow. Adults who use hyperbolic or overly emotional (?) language really confuse me. I cannot understand children until they hit about 11yo unless they are asking about a thing i can see. The school suggested counseling when I was maybe 10 to help my mother and I communicate better but she took it as an attack on her parenting and we never discussed it again until almost 20 years later...  ...Here we are in the present. Communication between my mom and I is still...not good. We've tried some ground rules, Say what you mean and mean what you say being rule #1. She just can't or won't do it. I feel like I am left with 2 options now that mutually agreed upon boundaries hasn't worked: We try therapy/mediation or just go no contact. She says that it would be hypocritical of her to go to therapy, so she won't do it. I was thinking it would be hypocritical if a mental health professional refused to go to therapy, unless they have a good/logical/rational reason, like i'm actually doing fine. no relationship/emotional issues here. That last sentence has never been something she has said, btw. The only other reason I have heard from her is They'll violate HIPAA and everyone will know my dirty laundry! She is *not* well known in her field, this does not seem rational to me.   **resume query**  Is this a normal viewpoint among mental health professionals? Also, other than a therapist is there something like a mediator for this type of situation? I feel like we could use some professional help to understand each other."
"I'll try to keep this short. I'm a generally happy person, always have been. I'm in my late twenties, I have a wonderful partner, live in a cool city, have hobbies and a strong circle of friends. However, my job is literally killing me. Three years ago I was promoted from a tech to an engineer. It came with more money, more responsibility, freedom, the usual bullshit. And now I realize it's literally killing me. Its a very stressful position but not in the usual, too much work not enough time. Or not in the, theres a lot of heavy lifting kind of work. My current position has me doing very little engineering. I'll try to explain this in a way that doesn't bore you but still gets my perspective across. I was hired to fix the products we manufacture that don't pass our tests. But quite often it's the tests that are the problem. So I work with the people who write the tests to show them that the product is fine, but their test needs some adjustment or tweaking. And this leads to a lot of animosity directed towards me because I'm young and new and the test designers (as well as product designers) are old. They are old and protective and mean. I often have to try and fix things that failed a test that I have no idea what it was testing or how it was testing. They guard their test plans, test schematics, and test programs quite strongly. I no longer engineer but rather try and pry information from these people. All the while my supervisors hound me about product that is marked failed but really the test needs revision. This all might sound trivial and superficial but it's like trying to finish a sudoku puzzle that was designed to never be finished. It's like trying to cook something from a recipe that was designed to make sure you screw up the meal. These old engineers don't want to disclose their tests or methods and they make that damn well known.     I've discussed this issue with my bosses and I always get the same yes you are correct, we will work with you on this, this is bullshit, we need to change things up. And then a few hours later they are on my tail about why we have so many failed products. This cycle goes on for months and months. I start grinding my teeth in my sleep, I've gotten teeth pulled, my face is puffy and inflamed, I can barely move my neck. There always one day of the week I come home and just cry into a pillow until I fall asleep. I started heavily drinking more or less just to fall asleep. I send out mass resumes and hear nothing back. I have a large savings I could live on for awhile but the thought of quitting (I've never quit a job before) just kills me. But looking at myself in the mirror also kills me these days. I go between HUMAN UP AND FIGURE THIS JOB OUT and THERES NO WAY TO WIN HERE ABORT ABORT ABORT. No one will ever know how hard it is to be in this scapegoat position. I've tried to get my old job back but it's just not going to happen. I have dreams where I muster the courage to quit and then I'm unemployed for years.    If you've ever been in a similar position I would love to hear about it. If you are currently in a position like this, PM me and lets talk about it. I just need to talk. My friends and partner are all the kind of people who would have left this situation already but I'm stubborn and have spent three years trying to fix a systematic problem much bigger than me. I'm so stubbern I'll likely be here until I do something drastic. Help?"
"This is kind of an odd topic but one I need help with. My therapist is trying to use the IFS model of therapy on my internal world. He says that I shouldn't engage in BDSM because it would retraumatize the self. I disagree in that I am doing it with a group that all the rules are agreed on in advance, consent plays a major role in their dynamic. It also lets me express the kinky part of me in ways that are safe, I have had this part of me since I was young but kept it hidden till my late 20s. The owners of the group have 20+ years experience in the scene.  Any tips?"
"Are you a male that has been told by a doctor or other professional that you might be depressed in the last three weeks?   * We're interviewing men to get a better understanding of what you think depression is and what it's like to talk to a doctor about it. Understanding your perspective will be extremely valuable for filling a gap in research on men's experiences of depression.  * As compensation for your time and effort in participating in two short interviews, you'll be given $20, that's $10 for the first interview and $10 for the second interview. The study is recruiting men aged 18 or older who would be willing to spend 30-40 minutes talking with a researcher about these topics.   * We ask that you contact us as soon as possible--no longer than three weeks after you were first told by a doctor or other professional that you might be depressed.   * The interview will be conducted by phone or in-person for residents of Central Massachusetts or the Greater Boston Area. We will also call you six months after we interview you to check in and do another brief 10-20 minute interview.   * You'll be asked a series of questions, and you may decline any question that you do not want to answer.

"Hello, If anyone could give me some tips on how I can bring up BiPolar with my GP? I am 21 and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder last year when around my 21st birthday. A few months after being diagnosed with MDD, I began feeling incredible, the term I used at the time was euphoric. I'm not going to get into what happened but those couple months where I felt like that were amazing and then it was like a huge wave and my MDD came back in full force. Its been about a month now and I'm having my up and down states, I currently take Citalopram but I was researching up the other night about what has happened to me in the last year and I ultimately came out with Bipolar Disorder Type 2, it matched me so much that I feel its something I should bring up with my GP but I'm not very good with talking to people and cant seem to understand how to bring it up."
"My depression has beaten me. It consumes my life. I'm not strong enough to fight it. I really really don't want to give up, but I can't keep fighting in vain.   Can't I just have a day off from this hell?"
"So I have OCD and my boyfriend told his family that I have it. I would have rather that he hadn't and didn't expect him to. But at the same time I understand that he probably wanted someone to talk to and maybe thought he was helping or just assumed I wouldn't mind. It's just that I didn't expect it and also I was already worried that his mother and sister may not like me al that much. So Also it just made me a bit uncomfortable them knowing as I didn't want them treating me differently or looking at me funny (more than they already). It wasn't a big deal. But it just me think what the etiquette (do to speak) on this type of thing is and I'm just curious what experiences everyone has with this, from either position. Thanks."
"Hi. I'm posting to Reddit because I currently have a very big problem. First off, I am schizophrenic but I'm not referring to those voices (though I get the same feeling I get when I'm hearing regular voices). I'm referring to voices in general. I can handle one person talking, but when multiple people are talking (especially in the background) it causes me great physical and mental pain. I don't know what to do to make it stop. Since I now live in a recovery home and am no longer alone they have been near constant. Please, if anyone knows anything about this or advice let me know. Sorry if I'm bothering anyone by posting here but I really need help."
"I've been severely depressed in the last few years, so much so it's starting to affect my work. I've made an appointment with my doctor to get a referral to a mental health professional. I'm wondering what I should expect. I know everyone has different issues and we handle things differently, but when I finally see a professional are they just going to try and put me on drugs, or are we going to do a lot of talking. To be honest I don't know where to start with my problems, let alone explain them well. I just know that somethings wrong with me. I just want to feel ok but I dont. I cry a lot, I don't eat right, I barely sleep. I'm messed up. I guess with this post I just wanted to talk to someone about what I'm going through. Thanks for listening..."
"Every now and then I get this urge to throw myself in a deep sad sorrow. I don't know why. There's always that want or need to dig the deepest possible pit, and just stay in it. Emotional pain is something I'm good at. It's something I know. It's easy. Whenever I'm alone, in bed or just in a room, sitting in darkness. I can't help, but realize how sudden lonely I am. I start looking for sad stories, remembering sad movies or something to intensify it. I want the pain. I need it. Its apart of me...because this pain feels like it's the only thing that's real..."
"My girlfriend had some issues and it affected our relationship, in the end it was really bad, constant fighting and yelling and the last day it went straight to hell. She says she loves me and wants to be with me but that she needs time to make herself feel better before, she promised that there's no one else and that she wants to start over with me once she feels better.   I'm just so scared, i myself have anxiety and this broke me pretty bad. The first days were rough, i had to take time off work to just lay in bed and cry. I've reached out to her some and all she says is that i need to give her space and time, but it's so hard. I see that she's online and my thoughts start going out of control. What if she's texting another guy? etc etc. And when she goes offline for several hours it's the same thing. What if she's with another guy? etc etc. I can't help myself, my thoughts just runs out of control and it cripples me.   I need to not contact her but it's so hard... I need to get my thoughts under control but i don't know how. I need help.   I love her and i want her back after she has had her space but i'm so scared she has someone new..."
"Not really sure what to even say here...   My partner and I are going to have to start spending longer periods of time apart due to work commitments and it's sending my anxiety in to meltdown. I've always struggled with general anxiety but now I'm really struggling with the idea of not seeing him as much. I sound really stupid, I get that, but I'm not sure how to deal with this side of my anxiety issues. Any advice would be great."
It helped a bit but they weren't able to treat me at all due to the fact of me not having a serious mental illness. But after i explained my situation and what got me there it just didn't help. I came home today angrier than i had been in months almost 2 years. Why can't i just stop feeling like this.
"sorry if that title makes no sense, i cant figure out how to word it. currently i have 4 diagnosis's that i take medication for and am/have recieved help for:  major depressive disorder- currently on 40mg lexapro, used to take zoloft and been in and out of therapy for ~10 years, currently not in therapy   generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder: lexapro is mostly for this after my psychitrists decided anxiety was the main problem and not depression, which i don't agree with at all but whatever  adhd: take 30 mg adderall  im starting to think ive got a lot more than just these but im scared to actually go to try and get help again. i barely scratch the surface of my problems with my therapists because when i open up i just get sent to the psych ward for a few months and i hate it and it makes me want to die even more so thats why im on reddit i guess. anyway like i said i think i have a lot more problems than they think i have, ill try my best to explain what i think i have and why, and i appreciate any opinions. please know im trying my best to tell the truth and explain things from how they are in my mind, which is always really jumbled and never makes sense so sorry if you can't understand  borderline personality disorder: i think this might be a big one, my last therapist, i saw her for a year and she was probably the person i've been most honest with about anything in my life. unfortunately i lost that ability after she sent me to a hospital. but she said it really sounded like i might have bpd from some of the things i say. i feel empty a lot of the time, its always kind of like a sad empty. but not really sad, if that makes any sense. like i want to cry but i just feel like i dont have the ability to. and then when something happens, the emotion i get should be only a little bit, but since theres just something there to fill the emptiness i feel it a million times stronger than i should be feeling it. i also have been in love with the same woman for like 8 years, and i feel like she's the decider of my emotions. im so scared of losing her because shes everything to me, i dont have anything but her so what do i have if shes gone. shes tried leaving me in the past before and when she does i just cut the shit out of myself because i just forget i exist without her, the pain reminds me that im there. and yes i know thats like the edgiest cringiest thing but its really how i feel, shes been the majority of the reason of my suicide attempts too. ive felt like ive loved other women since ive loved her but i start getting these thoughts that i convinced myself to fall out of love with her temporarily or something because i dont want to love her? i cant really explain it, but basically my mind fucks me into believing i love her no matter if i love her or hate her or dont even give a shit and i know its my mind fucking with me but the possibility of it being the truth confuses me, i fucking hate it. i dont even know why i think i hate her sometimes becuase i have no reason to hate her but i never take out the anger on her because there's no reason to but im so angry anyway and i take it out on others by just screaming and smashing everything in my sight and sometimes hitting others, i fucking hate my rage episodes but i cant do anything about it. and i just get high off of weed whenever i can because it makes things bearable, ive been abusing my adderall so much that i dont even get high anymore unless i take an insane amount. i just hide so much of who i am because im so scared it will be the end of me. man i could max out like 10 reddit posts about why i think i have this disorder alone but i want to get on to the rest of this too so.  schizophrenia: this is one that i can't tell if i even have because i've been denying the chance that i have it for my whole life, but its been lingering in my mind for soooo long and this is the first i ever say about it to anyone other than my head. ive been denying it because, when you think of a fucking batshit crazy person, this is the type of disorder, and i want to believe that i'm not actually that crazy. but at this point i just kind of accept that i'm past being normal so whatever. so, i think i wrote a lot in my last paragraph that could fit just as well into this part, so im not gonna rewrite all of that. in addition to whatever seemed schizophrenic from the last thing, im just paranoid of so much more than just losing people. like im concerned 24/7 that people are thinking bad thoughts about me, like everyones just kind of watching my every move and taking note of it. even some random person walking down the street might be just noting what im doing. and i don't think they're giving that information to the government or anything like that schizophrnia stereotype, but who knows what they could be doing with the information? that just freaks me out. and its like there's a voice that just tells me when they're watching, when they're judging, what theyre saying. and i think im not supposed to believe it but i dont know what to believe. and then i get scared that people know what im thinking, thats the worst one. when im around people i just try to shut off my own mind because im scared they're gonna know but the voice just doesn't wanna stop. and im just paranoid that im being watched and judged over EVERYTHING, it makes doing anything so hard that i just avoid most things. im 18 years old and just starting driving too, and i hate it so much i want to cry every time im driving because im so scared other people are thinking im a bad driver and are going to call the police on me for reckless driving or something and i just have anxiety attacks every time i drive. also about the voice, i cant tell if theres multiple voices or not but there's been 1 distinct voice and its my own. i always thought it was just my conscience or something but its like i just talk to myself in my head about everything and try to convince myself what's happening isn't the truth. or maybe it's not actually me, i dont know. that's probably the biggest problem i just have to QUESTION everything that happens, like i can't tell whats real and whats my mind fucking with me or what's actually just not even happening at all. to be honest i doubt anyone is even reading at this point, and if they are i dont know why, maybe it's for a good reason but my mind is just trying to convince me that you're doing it to hurt me. and i know that is irrational but what if it's the truth. i see things sometimes too, i hear things a lot more than i see things. just random things, ill just imagine a guy walking buy or someone calling my name or saying things to me. it gets crazy when im high too, i know weed is a very mild psychedelic but i hallucinate and get paranoid more than anyone i've ever heard of on weed, like i get some shrooms type effects from small amounts of weed and im pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. i've also had this reccuring thought since i was really young, that im the only one who actually exists. like, there's no way for me to know if anything even existed before i did and that's so scary, because it means either i sort of am responsible for everything that happens, and maybe my mind just made up history and how people are and etc. and there's a lot of fucked up things in history so if i created all those things then i'm really fucked up. and when there are other people, theres no way to know if they're actually real and not just some emotionless thing there that i created. and then i start thinking, what does anything even matter because i made it all up anyway. but if i do something bad then i can go to jail or some other consequence, and thats stupid because i made the consequences, and i just get lost in my mind and i freak out. this is the kind of stuff that happens so often and i hate it I HATE IT SO FUCKING MUCH ITS LIKE LIVING IN HELL. I DONT WANT TO LIVE IN MENTAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BUT THIS IS WHAT GOES ON IN MY HEAD EVERY DAY. THINKING ABOUT THIS MAKES ME THINK IM CRAZY AND I KNOW NO ONE IS GONNA READ THIS WITHOUT THINKING IM EITHER BULLSHITTING OR CRAZY OR FUCKING STUPID OR SOMETHING I DONT CARE I PROMISE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. AND NOW THAT I STARTED THINKING PEOPLE ARENT GOING TO BELIEVE ME I CANT EVEN BELIEVE IF WHAT I WROTE WAS REALLY TRUE. PLEASE SOMEONE FUCKING HELP ME TELL ME THIS IS A REAL ILLNESS I DONT EVEN CARE IF ITS SCHIZOPHRENIA OR NOT ANYMORE JUST TELL ME THAT ITS MY MIND FUCKING WITH ME,"
"I don't really know where to put this. Was searching around and just stumbled upon this subreddit. So i myself study psychology, although i dont know everything i know the basics and some in in depth subjects. However its difficult to deal with your own problems even though you know what you ought do.   Now i am not going to go in depth mainly because im on my phone and dont feel like sitting here for an hour writing the full story. Long story short, i experienced trauma from losing someone close. It wasn't the fact that i lost them but in the way that i lost them that bothered me the most. They were just gone with no explanation and the person was my therapy from a previous incident. Not having anyone to sort of keep me on track led into a downfall up until i basically took on an entire new personality. (Im not talking about DID here, just a change). I change into a psychopath who wants to cause pain to others. Not through physical means but as much emotional pain possible because that is the way i felt when the incident happened. It can be an instant flip in personality. When someone repeats the incident i just go into this state where i could basically kill my own family and have no remorse or emotion doing it or after. I am a very loving guy. I believe in peace, but i guess all those years of bottle up and displaced emotion created this alternate personality where one minute i can be completely fine and then the next have an episode. I just dont know how to resolve this problem. It only occurs when someone triggers it. No i dont have any therapist. Im good on that. Ive been to enough psychiatrists in my life. Im not a fan of them."
"Some of my doctors think I have bipolar disorder, but others think it's just depression. Either way, I'm in a manic state right now. I don't eat, I don't sleep, and I never stop doing things. I can't keep up with my own thoughts and ideas. I'm not necessarily happy. In fact, I cry a lot when it's time for me to sleep, because I feel so lonely. Other than the crying, I kind of enjoy this whole mania thing, but I know it won't last forever. I need advice on how to avoid dropping into a depressive episode, or how to cope with it. I can't imagine going from this (doing everything, all day, everyday) to suddenly not wanting to even get out of bed. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"I am realizing that a good portion of feeling like I am in a black hole of never getting better is due to one or more detrimental cycles.  Example: Feeling not good enough (with where I am in life) causes severe stress, binge eating to relieve stress, gaining weight from binge eating, lower self esteem from being the heaviest I have ever been, feeling even more not good enough.  It's not going to stop unless I make a concerted effort to eliminate or at the very least alleviate some of the sections of these cycles. I would feel accomplished even if I just slowed it down so it wouldn't be escalating as quickly.  Trying to get better is so exhausting. (sigh)"
"Last Tuesday I had a random, automatic thought of swallowing whole bunch of pills. When I called up the dr. to tell him this he told me to go to the ER. The thought lasted maybe 10-15 minutes tops and it went away again.   I'm afraid of being told off for not going. I have my appointment tomorrow morning. What do I say when he asks why I didn't go??  UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I told the doctor about what happened. We attributed my random thought to the other medical complications I have going on. He was a little relieved I didn't have to go."
I lost it all. I love you Richard. I'm sorry I killed all your love for me. I know you will never forgive me for what I've done. You are my everything. The pain is unbearable. I want no life without you. Time to go. Remember the good. I love you with all I am. I'm just to broken. I can't fix me and I've hurt all of you enough. I can't be there and see you knowing I killed off the best part of my life. Remind my kids they are my world. I cannot subject any of y'all to the hurt and damage I caused. Please remember only the good and maybe one day forgive me. I love you all more than you will ever know. Goodbye   Your Funny Face

"Hello redditors, I would appreciate your advises because I really don't know what to do anymore.  A little backstory  We are a family of 5 males and 1 female. I am the youngest of the family and most of the times I am the one on giving out advice to my brothers and sister. Of course being the youngest I am not always heard as I should. My siblings are around the age of 40-50 and I am 33.  One of my brothers has always been the misfit and everybody except me were judgemental to him. I always calmly tried to support him and advice him.  6 Years ago my brother had a huge accident with his bike and was in a coma for a month or so and had a long recovery extending to about two years. At that time my mom took him in helping him during the recovery process. At the same time his wife gave birth to their son.  The last 4-5 years I watched my brother withdrawing to him self and handling situations really badly. Eventually he ended up having misunderstandings with a lot of our relatives and his friends. At the same time he was telling stories of how this or that relative treat him badly. I din't have a way to find out who is right or wrong but again I was supportive telling him to remove this negative energy he was having.  This one last year the situation deteriorated badly. My brother claims that his wife treated him like shit and that she was sleeping around. Eventually they divorced but he has an obsession with her but instead of realising this obsession he says that all he does is for the sake of his son.  To make matters really worst he claims that our mom actually told her wife to divorce him so she hates her now. Also my sister got into this by having my brother's ex to come over with their son so he can be with my sister's sons and play with them.  Now the situation is that he claims that my sister and his ex are into having sex with a lot of people and my sister's husband knows about that and actually endorse it.  I can't verify his claims but I am pretty sure that he is delusional, because a couple of times when I tried to verify his claims, the facts didn't add up. As an example, last Sunday he was out of his mind that his ex and my sister they were out in the morning fucking around. What they actually did is to take the kids to the cinema and because her ex did not answer her phone, this whole plot came to realisation in his mind.  One of his main claims is that he behaves like this because he worries for his son but 95% of his talking is how much of a slut his ex is. This got me to the conclusion that he actually has an obsession with his ex.  At the same time after the latest events my sister and brother-in-law felt threatened and considered taking actions against my brother...not good actions...to the point my sister told me if we (the male parts of the family) did not do anything about him she will hire someone to beat him up...not pretty stuff. So I asked her to give me some time to figure out what to do.  So I gathered all of my brothers and told them to stop being judgemental any more and consider their brother as a sick person who needs help. My brothers all agreed to that and I told them I would try to convince him to seek some help. I did tried several times (not just in the last month) to talk him into seeking help but never came to a result.  This last time we talked, I lost my patience and became really angry at his claims, we had a huge talk-fight over the situation and at that point I realised that I could't do anything anymore, because this whole thing started to affect me and how I react to his claims. So I decided to cut the cord and told him that I don't want to listen to his problems anymore and he has to find some medical help immediately. This got him to respond really badly to me (This is the first time doing it to me), and told me he doesn't want to talk with me for a long time. So I sent him a message via messenger. I quote.  &gt;Yesterday I realised three things. &gt; &gt;1. I canâ€™t keep calm anymore dealing with any of your issues, so &gt;I choose to disengage.  &gt; &gt;2. Itâ€™s been a long time that youâ€™re asking me to choose sides. &gt;Moreover youâ€™re asking me to stand against my own mother and &gt;sister. I hope you can respect the fact that I wonâ€™t do that and &gt;also that I wonâ€™t stand against you as I never did. &gt;  &gt;3. I have been close to you this whole time after the accident as &gt;I watched you drag yourself in situations where everybody is to &gt;blame. I explained a million times that this blaming game wonâ€™t &gt;lead anywhere. And here we are now. &gt; &gt;Also let me tell how exactly your behaviour has been these last &gt;years. You fuck things up somehow blaming this and that for any &gt;reason. I am telling you that you need to relax and be calm, and &gt;you always tell me that I am somehow right and what you want is &gt;to get this money (from the house or the insurance or whatever) &gt;and be left alone and you wonâ€™t bug anyone anymore. And this &gt;endless cycle goes on and on. &gt; &gt;So I am telling you nowâ€¦itâ€™s all at your hand. Break the cycle or &gt;stay in it and be miserable. If you decide to continue as is then I &gt;canâ€™t help anymoreâ€¦if you decide to do something differently at &gt;any time, then I stand by you.   So, after connecting the dots of these last years I think my brother has some kind of psychosis and creates delusions in his mind. Moreover that accident must caused the psychosis to get worst.  I am not left with much choices really and the action I am yet willing to take is to gather again the brothers so we can figure out what to do.  I desperately need your help redditors...I am out of options.  Thanks"
"Recently, maybe hormonal I'm not sure, I have been really struggling with coping with my sexual frustration. I can't go an hour without thinking about something sexually and physically feel like I can't control my impulses. I'm worried that if it continues I might do something stupid. Any ideas on how to combat this slightly?"
"I know its normal to say things out loud like now where did I put that usb or ahh fuck that hurt. But I mean, at work or in the car or shower etc I will have full blown back and forth conversations in my head, imagining what a particular person what might say back to me. It often starts as a normal conversation or a joke I want to crack but sometimes it escalate's into full blown arguements and I feel myself actually getting anxious and angry and caught up in it until I manage to snap myself out of it and realise Ive just spent the last 10 minutes argueing with myself in my head.          I have bad anxiety and occasionally depression issues (mainly depressed that my anxiety is ruining my life) but aside from that no known mental issues or diagnosis. Does anyone else do this? Is this normal or am I nuts?"
"My Mom lives in Michigan and is 60 years old. She is suffering from depression and anxiety and I believe she is an undiagnosed Hypochondriac. This is causing her to avoid social situations, travel (staying in hotels, eating out, flying planes), and effecting her work. She has self-diagnosed multiple health problems over the past 10 years including serious food allergies, serious allergies to perfumes and other scents, hypersensitivity to touch, always feeling cold, and a muscle strain lasting the past 2 years which she claims has not improved from physical therapy or medication. The scent allergies trigger panic attacks and have caused her to miss work or restrict her job duties.   In addition to her mental health issues in the past 2 years she has:  * Lost her second husband to a brain tumor and fought with his family over the estate.  * Been the victim of a wire fraud Romance Scammer who took her for her entire savings and most of her retirement funds.  * Is on the brink of foreclosure and serious financial trouble.  While she is still capable of working it has affected her work performance (leaving early because of panic attacks, avoiding work duties that could trigger them) and she badly needs a new job with better pay and more hours. At 60, Iâ€™m afraid sheâ€™ll face age discrimination and doubts about her ability to work as a nurse on a regular floor shift. Iâ€™m afraid that she canâ€™t pay for proper treatment, and her employability is pretty poor. The short term problem for her is her financial situation and our family is in talks about helping her with that, but the long term help she needs is really mental health treatment. If going on disability for mental health would provide the help she needs, I think itâ€™s worth exploring.   So hereâ€™s what I want to ask:  What generally qualifies someone for Disability Benefits for Mental Health?   Does it have to be bad enough to be a condition that utterly doesnâ€™t allow them to function in a job or supporting themselves? Like Severe Schizophrenia, Bipolar, etc?  Am I thinking the requirements are too stringent here and there lesser mental health issues that would be allowed?  If lesser forms of mental illness qualify then what would other requirements be? Risk of harm to self? Risk of harm to others? Proof of being incapable of working?  Would it take being admitted to a treatment facility to start that application process? How much do health insurance benefits typically cover for that?  Assuming she sought in patient treatment for a length of time and committed to therapy how long of a process would it typically be to qualify for benefits?  I can go into much more detail describing her issues and situation if it would help those commenting on this."
She recently had to leave work because she suffered a breakdown. She has been working in hospitals for almost 20 years and it has never effected her work other then having to take a medical leave(it has never effected a patient nor would she ever go to work not in her right state of mind) she now has to inform employers of this and Its making it extremely difficult for her to find a job. Is there something she can do? If she cant get back to nursing and takes a entry level job she will loose her house and car. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   Also is there a better place to post this? Im new to reddit.
https://twitter.com/FezOfPez/status/824328570042466304  I'll try to answer any questions people may have too if curious. Thank you if you do tweet with the hashtag today or retweet any bits of my story.
"This is the first time, and I guess a first step and attempt of uncovering what may be a very, very dark fragment of my past, or not. Over the past two years, and currently I've basically kept coming to the question: Is it possible that I have been sexually assaulted as a child?  In the last year I battled very heavy depression, and succeeded (yay!). It included taking a leave from my studies, searching and finally finding an appropriate therapist and even a voluntary stay at a sanatorium (a clinic that specialised in the treatment of depression through psychotherapy, their core concept was facing your traumata's and what caused the depression). During that year I've realised and learned a lot. I learned that I had kept certain parts of me locked away because I couldn't face it. Overall, I can see within that last year and in that battle, I finally after nearly 15 ish years managed to find myself.  Before I even knew or realised that I was suffering under depression I was suffering, without a sense. I thought I was just too weak and that everyone would experience what I experienced.  It was during this time where panic attacks started to form and in extreme cases a physical paralysis. It was also in this time where the thought for my question was sparked:  While at home, out of nowhere and without any context words formed in my mind: What if I had been sexually assaulted as a child? That moment was so strong, that it initiated the first panic attack and the first experience of that kind of paralysis. All I could feel was utter and complete terror, even just thinking IF such a possibility existed. At this point I should mention that at the time, a vast majority of memories from my past were not accessible to me. It seemed like there were fragments, images here and there but not a coherent string of memories, most of them clouded in some kind of mist.   The following night, I had a very terrifying nightmare. The thing abou this is, I usually don't have this. And it felt like a half-awake dream. Looking back at it, in a way it felt like my subcounscious opening up an allowing me in. The dream was as followed:  I was a child in my home village, walking along the streets with a female friend (who in reality I met far later in my life than my dream age and who didn't live in the same village). It seemed we wanted to meet with other people and we were already late. My friend, taking the lead suggests a shortcut leading through a construction site. I can't really agree nor disagree because she just goes ahead, with me running after her. As she gets to the construction site (I can point to the place from my dream in reality), she jumps off a big pile of dirt, down onto a half finished terrace in construction and leaves through a door that's been built to then meet up with the others. I catch her just as she dissappears with her shouting after me to come. Then it's deadly silent and a strange tension (like in a video game just before a boss fight) sets in. I jump off the same dirt pile but land clumsily. The moment I touch the ground the lamp on the wall with the door starts shining absurdly brightly striking complete terror into me. From a dug hole just next to the wall with the door some kind of figure emerges, I think a man. All I can remember is that this figure as shining bright eyes with light coming out of them, just the same light as from the lamp. The figure or man approaches and all I know is that somehow, my counscious 'dreaming' self 'knows': That's when it happens. 'Now he's about to rape me'. And I wake up.  I don't know, if this is indeed my subcounscious tying to tell me or if it's just a mechanism to shield from something else? That an assault never happened but if there's something else. In any case, I'M confused and I know that this state makes me incapable of a meaningful relationship of trust, without any shields or protection, or in a sappy way: That it makes me incapable of love.  I don't know why I'm sharing this. I guess I'm looking for someone who can relate or sympathise. Who can share a similar experience or advice. I'm just reaching out I think. I don't want sympathy all I really want is....to know...could it be that it happened? And what am I to do with these enigmatic clues. And maybe I should say again: There are still parts/ years of my memory that still seem not to be present. Which is why, I can't exclude it not happening even though I have no memories of such a possibility.   There have been other possible 'signs' but listing them might explode this already very long outreach so I will leave it at that.  If anyone wants to answer or listen to reach out to me in return, please let me know.  I'm fine overall, as I said I came out of that battle better than ever and would consider myself pretty happy. Though maybe the fact that I overcame all that just means I can now look at the other things to tackle (like a new level).  In any case, thank you for reading and your time. And I wish you (anonymous reader I don't know) all the best."
"TLDR is at the bottom.   I'm 22 years old and a few months ago I had to temporarily move back in to my parent's house due to financial struggles. They're good parents. Not perfect, but nobody is. They love me very much and they help me out whenever I need it. They've always had my back.   However, for whatever reason, I feel extremely uncomfortable around them. I've been diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety, and Borderline Personality Disorder. But, for the life of me I can't connect anything to why I feel so uneasy around my parents. I get major anxiety with the upset stomach and heavy chest. And my depression gets worse too. If they start talking about anything beyond work or chores, I shut down.   This has progressively been getting worse. I've never had a super close relationship with them. But slowly, any relationship I did have is being dissolved. It's gotten to the point where I don't physically touch them at all, I avoid all eye contact, and I try to avoid almost any contact at all. I've tried to just push through it and develop a relationship again, but every time I just feel like I need to be anywhere else.  I don't know what's happening and it's scary. I love my parents, and I've tried to explain to them what is happening but they get understandably hurt. There's no major event or breakdown between us to explain this. So why is it happening?!? Even if I am upstairs in my room, the sound of them moving around will make my skin crawl. I stay petrified in my bed until I can't hear any trace of them.   And I should specify that it is only them. I have normal anxiety around most people, but it's maintainable. For some reason, I just can't stand to be around my parents.   Please help me if you can! If anybody has ever experienced this, or can help me understand why, I would greatly appreciate it.   TL;DR: 22, living with good parents. For unknown reason I get major major anxiety around them. It's ruining our relationship and I'm at a complete loss."
"Hi,  Ive had on and off depression for quite some time now and have always had general anxiety. Recently the anxiety has been getting to the point where i feel nearly unable to function.  Ive been worrying about everything. When i say everything, i don't just mean the usual stuff (money, marital, arguments from 10 years ago), but ive been worrying about what the point in anything and everything is. Whats the point in going to work? Whats the point in paying taxes? Why is life the way it is, because, to be honest, everything fucking sucks.  I cant properly put it into words. I used to think when i was younger that there must be a reason why im me if you know what i mean. I can only see the world from my first person perspective. i thought i may be somehow special because of this. Now im beginning to realise that in the grand scheme of things, im fuck all. Everything we do doesnt matter. I go to work and have some dickhead tell me what to do, thats all i know so i do it. But why should i? Why does the world have to be that way? Money is just an illusion. It sucks. Politicians make decisions for us. They suck. Spend all my time working a job i hate because i have to. Its all fucking pointless. I feel like we are all wasting our lives on the illusion of life we have created ourselves.  I know im rambling and i dont know if it makes sense but i cant stop feeling this way. It gets me so down and so worried that we are all just wasting our lives. And the worst part is that it won't change. Thats how things are. Its shit.  Does anyone else feel this way or at least understand what i mean? Or does anybody know how to stop feeling this way?"
"hi, iâ€™m going to be locked up for 23 hours with a female sadist, and Iâ€™m not really scared, just want to receive some advice so nothing goes wrong, thank you, I'm a guy btw"
"My dog is an ESA dog as well as a service dog. Meaning, I have a housing/airline document from a licensed therapist for flying/living with an ESA dog. When the dog finished learning his complex cues, he became my service dog, although in all honesty we are still working on public manners, that might take an additional few months until he's done. He helps with a variety tasks.   We are moving to a new place, the real estate agent is forcing a $500 fee just for the dog and said if we don't agree to it he will give the house to someone else. Nice."
"A Letter to my Addiction.  No More Written By R.K.  â€œHave you ever loved someone so much, youâ€™d give an arm for?  Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm herâ€ Eminem: â€œWhen Iâ€™m Goneâ€  Everyone has something or someone that directly relates to this quote in someway, shape, or form. The proverbial â€œherâ€ in my case is referring to my family and close friends. My situation is unique as it does not begin the way a stereotypical addiction story begins. No broken homes or traumatic childhood experiences here, quite the opposite in fact. I come from a healthy household surrounded by loving family members inside the brick walls and an unsurpassed quality of friends outside of them, friends whom I first met over 20 years ago. I went to good grade schools, was considered a gifted child (believe it or not) and was doing school work a year ahead of my class. I didnâ€™t realize it at the time, but my life was set. All I had to do was keep doing what I was doing and keep pushing forward. Everything was sunshine and rainbows, right up until I met a new â€œfriendâ€. I didnâ€™t know how I felt about this friend at first since I didnâ€™t know anything about them. I must have been wearing sunglasses at the time considering I failed to see the dark cloud closely following that â€œfriendâ€, not noticing how exponentially larger the shadow was compared to the figure casting it. Sunglasses on, I kept hanging out with said friend since it seemed kinda cool at the time, cool enough for me to want that friend to come around more often. This turned out to be a series unforeseen mistakes which ultimately paved the way to my demise.  At first, friend, you were pretty awesome. You came to hang out at parties, making the nights more eventful and exciting. Unfortunately this opened a set of floodgates thousands of miles away, floodgates similar to the ones Treebeard released on Isengard to help save Middle Earth. However, these destructive waters that were headed my way werenâ€™t coming to save anyone, they werenâ€™t coming to diminish any evil and they werenâ€™t coming to water the plants or feed the crops. The only thing they were going to do was obliterate everything in their path while morphing things that took years to build into a rural wasteland, ultimately changing the way that people looked at that piece of land. Perhaps forever. Everything seemed fine in my apparently gifted mind, me having been mistaken would be an understatement. You, my friend, were deceiving me. You did not want to be my friend. You never wanted to be my friend. What I can see now is that was your elaborate cover up to start taking everything of mine. I must say, you masked your deception quite well. I was the King deep in slumber and while I was dreaming, you were taking my Pawns, my Bishopâ€™s, my Knights and Rooks, and my Queen.   At first you only wanted my free time, and I was ok with that. Then you got greedy, you wanted more. You wanted my money, you wanted my friends, you wanted the girls that I liked and the family that I loved. You â€œwantingâ€ ultimately led to you taking. You took my personality, you took my laughter and you took my laid back attitude, you took all of it. Thatâ€™s not even the worst part, the worst part is you somehow made me not care. You somehow made this former gifted child's mind into a slave, your slave.  â€œI Am Whatever You Say I Amâ€ Eminem: â€œThe Way I Amâ€  I used to be the guy in the first quote. Over the span of 10 years, you changed me into the guy in that last one. Luckily, I had something that you did not foresee, an ace up my sleeve if you will. An ace that unknowingly made its way up my sleeve over 20 years ago. Just as it seemed like you were winning the war, the sun rose on the 5th day at Helmâ€™s Deep, reinforcements have arrived. And the reinforcements brought reinforcements, all of whom rode in on white horses. Ground support was abundant and helped me fight back, but it still wasnâ€™t enough to slay the dragon. An investment in air support needed to be made. With ground and air support at my disposal I am now able to attack from all directions and defend against all flanks. Your time is up and the end is near, your reign of terror WILL come to an end.  Boots on the ground, wings in the air To get rid of you there was no prayer. You won many battles in the past I refuse to be the one who finishes last.  You will not be the one wins this war I am whatever you say I am no more. -R.K."
"I have a (probably) anxiety-related issue where my stomach/lungs/throat steadily starts churning, tightening, frothing, etc. This makes me first feel uncomfortable, then it gets painful then I feel nauseated. Finally I get extreme pain and throw up (which doesn't make it go away).   The odd thing is the cure is simply lying down. As soon as I can lie down for a while all the symptoms go away.   I had medical checks that found nothing so I got CBT for three years. I get it less often now but it still happens regularly and is easily the worst thing in my life. I hate it and feel I have almost no control over it. The best I can do is lie down in a park or on the train or wherever I can to avoid the symptoms when I'm away from my bed.   If you've heard of anything similar or have any ideas for me I'd be very grateful to hear. It may be similar to some forms of IBS, but I don't think it's really connected to what I eat or drink."
Just wondering...
"Last Friday I talked a bipolar girl out of trying to kill herself and we became friends really fast. The only problem is that even though I always try my hardest to make her feel better and listen to her problems, it feels like the second I mention any of my problems she just doesn't want anything to do with me and she just gets upset and starts getting angry and suicidal again. I don't want to stop being friends with her but I just have no idea how to talk to her. The only reason we're even talking now is because another mutual friend apologized for me. I'm just so fucking lost."
"I mean i knew i was depressed, i knew i had mood switches and i knew i had heavy anxiety but somehow PTSD never clicked for me. I mean it still doesn't, i thought i was bipolar but PTSD sounds so much more serious than what i feel. I mean according to my psychologist i got PTSD from being bullied but i just don't get how that puts me under the same category as a traumatized war veteran. I feel like i haven't suffered enough to be able to have PTSD yet the diagnosis is official.    And i just don't know what i'm gonna tell people, i mean only my mom and i know about my PTSD now, outside of the psych ofcourse. My friends know i have social anxiety but that's it, and my school's counselor barely believes i actually have social anxiety and says i just want to skip class.     Stuck between a rock and a hard place it seems."
"I am a 17 year old girl and have been feeling very very depressed and suicidal lately. Substance abuse, depression, and bipolar disorder all run in my family and I think I may be developing depression or bipolar. Anyway, I feel uncomfortable talking to my parents about this but I have an appointment with a phycologist to talk to them about how I've been lately. I plan to tell the truth, which is that I do not constantly want to kill myself but I do think about it about every day and have freaking out panic attack sort of things (I don't know what to call it, it involves lots of screaming and banging my head against the wall and trying to claw at my skin.) where I feel like I REALLY REALLY want to kill myself, which happen anywhere from every few days to every few months, but recently about once a week. So my question is, if/when I tell a physiatrist about this, what will they most likely do? Will I have to go to a hospital for a while? Or if not, what will they do? I obviously know they will have to tell my parents, but how much of this do they have to tell them? I live in New York"

"In the spirit of bringing awareness to the stigmas around mental illness Iâ€™m going to share my story. I was diagnosed with adhd and aspergers syndrome (aka high functioning autism) when i was around 3. In hindsight I think 3 is really too young to make accurate diagnoses except in extremely obvious cases. But as a result, I grew up believing i had aspergers and being treated like people who have it are treated by society. I went to autism support groups with my mom when i was around 6/7 and socialized with other autistic kids of varying severity. In some kids the difference was obvious, but there was one boy in my support group who seemed normal to me. It wasn't until me and him had a reunion when I was 9 that i noticed his strange behavior. For example, he would steal my coloring book and use my pages, even though we both had the same book. When I protested he explained that â€˜you have to shareâ€™. He wasnâ€™t being cruel or ironic, this is how he interpreted the concept of sharing. I then realized that this sort of behavior is what defines him as a person with aspergers. That was the day I realized that I wasnâ€™t like him. From then on I questioned my diagnosis. By the time I was 13 I was certain I didnâ€™t have aspergers. The label officially remained until I was 17 (when I got rediagnosed). What I remember from when I identified as on the autism spectrum, is that adults would treat me fragilely and with exception, and peers/classmates would treat me as a sort of class pet. I resented a lot of them because for most of the ones who were kind to me I was just a tool for them to feel like a good person. They would volunteer to walk me to classrooms and do class work with the 'special needs girl', then tell their friends about it. But at recess and after school they didnâ€™t want to play with me or talk to me other than to be patronizing. I donâ€™t and have never had aspergers but just the label shaped me and separated me from others. Iâ€™m 19 now, I found out Iâ€™ve had General Anxiety Disorder and a Gifted-based Learning Disability when I got rediagnosed at 17(adhd and aspergers were removed from my diagnoses). Itâ€™s not something to really be happy about, but what makes me happy is finally identifying whats been wrong with me. My new medication keeps me feeling more normal and happy and safe than I ever have felt in my entire life. I still think that if i were never misdiagnosed as having Aspergers I would have had an easier childhood. Just growing up with that label changed me. That's just the power of the stigma around it. We can do better. Lets end the stigma around mental illness. #BellLetsTalk"
"Working with my therapist the current idea is that I cannot produce seratonin naturally (that's the chemical that makes you happy, right?) We're trying Sam-e and at this point I don't care if it's a natural medicine or what that helps me but I want to be happy (whatever that means) do antidepressants work by producing more seratonin? At my next appointment I'm considering asking to try a different med to give it a shot (also hoping it'll work quicker than sam-e but then again I'm not patient)"
"My husband of 20 years is finally seeking help for his depression. He recently told me that last year, before the psychiatrist and meds, he was dropping avid quite a bit.   I want to be understanding. I'm also pissed when I think, Fuck! That's why he was out of it all the time and I had to do most of the adulting!   Damn. I can't even say anything to him about it because he will feel judged and may not open up about other stuff in the future. Ugh.   Any thoughts?"
"Hello, my name is Evan and I am currently a highschool freshman in Michigan. For th past month now i have been going through intense periods of depressing thoughts. Although I know depression doesn't have any exceptions for gender, orientation, or economic class, I have little to nothing to be depressed about. I think one of the main causes of this is how I treat people. I have this thing where I treat people like dirt face to face but via messaging, I treat them with respect and kindness. I don't think I have any social problems but it seems thats how I treat people at default. I treat people like this and then when they call me out about it makes me think how terrible of a person I am and how I need to change but can't leading to intense periods of depression. How can I stop this destructive behavior before it puts me in a position of having no friends."
I feel down inexplicably during midday when indoors with lots of sunlight. Solution would be to close the curtain but this has the side effect of making room colder. Anyone else have this? I thought people usually get depressed during dusk when things are getting darker.
"Good evening friends, I am just under 30 years old and have been having trouble with my memory for years and years. It's so bad that it affects my daily life, work life, etc. I know in today's age of technology, it's easy to be distracted, but I can't even remember a thought or a to-do long enough to get out my notepad or phone to write it down! My wife always jokes that I have Alzheimers at 30 years old already but she's not far off. I struggle to remember things walking out of a work meeting even. The meeting happened yesterday? I can forget about knowing what the subject was.  Does anyone have any real proven exercises for improving memory or helpful tactics to help me cope with this?  Thanks!"
"I haven't been feeling like myself the last couple of days, I've been doubting myself, and constantly thinking of my relationship and life problems the whole day for the last two days which is probably due to my anxiety, but I just now, out of nowhere feel better again. Like something randomly switched in my brain and now whatever I was thinking about seems so insignificant. anyone else feel like this?"

i'm going nuts right now and i just want someone to talk to. any advice.
My therapist wants to send me to one.
"My husband and I became pregnant very unintentionally. This caused him to go from healthy and functioning to debilitatingly anxious and depressed. It takes all he has to go to work every day, leaving no energy for when he gets home to help with our daughter. This has been occurring for nearly 2 years. He has sought medical treatment, but nothing has solved the problems yet.  In the meantime, how can I help him? Is there anything that I can say or do? I have taken on all of the household responsibilities (caring for our daughter in the evenings, cooking, cleaning, errands, etc.) in the hopes that it would be one less anxiety in his life, but it hasn't seemed to make a difference. I really need help and advice. Is there anything I can say or do that can help him feel even a little bit better?"
"this is probably a really dumb question to ask and honestly, the last thing i'm doing is attention seeking.  i'm 17 years old and a girl. since i was around 12/13 i've always had very overwhelming feelings of sadness, thoughts of suicide and dealt with self harm. when i was around 13 i tried to kill myself for the first time, evidentially unsuccessfully. anyway, i've been to camhs multiple times (if you're not from the uk camhs is child and adolescent mental health services) and they've always told me i'm 'not bad enough' to be put on medication even though i've blatantly told them if everything doesn't get better soon i'll probably give up. it's really fucking exhausting being so so miserable since such a young age, is that normal? does everyone feel like that? i also have a breif memory of whenever i'd argue with my mum i'd always say things to her like 'well sorry i didn't ask to be born' even when i was about 11. when i was around 14 was the worst i've ever been up to the past year, i'd pretty much self harm every day even if the tiniest thing happened i'd plan to go home and self harm (nobody knew about my self harm until last year) but within the past year i've become a lot worse after seemingly starting to get 'better'. last april i was admitted to hospital with a very low haemoglobin and internal bleeding, i had to have an operation under general anaesthetic which led to me having psychosis which involved me thinking everybody in the hospital was trying to kill me, this lasted around 3 weeks and i wasn't discharged from hospital until it died down a lot but it didn't completely stop until after discharge. after this happening i've been very very low, i've gone back to self harm properly for the first time in around two years (i pretty much stopped doing it bc i got a boyfriend and i never liked people seeing my cuts) and the thoughts of suicide have come back on an at least daily basis, i'm not going to go through with it mainly because i don't have the balls to hurt everyone else at all (but then on the flip side of this i manage to convince myself most of the time that everybody would just replace me eventually, also one time while arguing with my grandad i told him i wanted to kill myself to which he replied 'go on then, there's pills and razors upstairs' which i'm sure contributed to it) i just feel very alone in the world and like i have nobody who actually cares, like i'm not going to sit here and be like wow i have no friends or anything because i do but i have nobody who i could sit there and pour my heart out without them being like what the fuck?? i guess i should add into this i smoke a fair amount of weed (almost every day) and sometimes hear things when i'm high (kind of electrical noises and sometimes distant voices) and i've taken acid 3 times (twice actual lsd and once 1p-lsd) whilst on acid was the most in awe and appreciative of the world i've ever been and the most at peace with myself i've ever felt whilst i've had these feelings, i should also probably add in that the first time i tripped off acid i saw cuts on my arm and ended up relapsing the other day as that might have some relevance to something and also in the same night heard like a family which i'm unsure if they were real or not, all of my trips have been wonderful though and never overall bad just sometimes slightly overwhelming.  i don't really know where else to go with this, you can ask me any questions about things thatve happened/symptoms or just say whatever you want, i have quite thick skin so you can say whatever honestly thank you"
"Hey everyone  I suffer from anxiety and depression. I am debating what vit/sup to get. I have read that omega 3s are helpful overall. 5 Htp as well. I've also read that kava root is good for anxiety, and St. John's wort is good for depression.   If you've had any luck or not please let me know.   Thanks in advance"
"Reddit, please help me find someone that can help and meets the following description I list below. I was referred here by /r/findareddit so hopefully you can help. In July 2015, I lost a very close friend of mine in a Line of Duty Death. She was an EMT, responding to a traffic accident, when a car blew the light, struck her ambulance, and killed her. She was a volunteer EMT on the same company I volunteered for as well. My other friend, we'll call him Guy for now, also volunteered on this company and was dating her at the time. Obviously, he was devastated at what occurred. He's mourned and went through the grieving process just like anyone would. The issue is, now it's a year and a half later and he is still deeply mourning over her death. I understand everyone heals differently, however he doesn't continue with the grief counseling or other help tactics, and is not getting any better on his own. He drinks his sorrows away in alcohol, putting down multiple bottles of wine a night. When drunk, he isolates himself from his friends, gets defensive and causes arguments, but worse of all drives drunk. There's been times where I had to wrestle him to the ground to keep him from driving. I've offered a shoulder to cry on, I've offered to attend meetings with him, and I've offered to try other healing measures but he tells me he is fine. The other day, he crashed his motorcycle riding drunk. Luckily he is okay, however I can't deal with his stupid and careless behaviour that he performs as a way to mourn over his loss. I've reached out to other friends, his family, and so on for help, but they either play the oh he's mourning it's okay and don't want to accept the truth card or they are unsure what to do as well. So Reddit, I beg you please, find me what I'm looking for. I'm looking for someone who has been in this situation for. Someone who has lost their husband or wife preferably if not any close relative, lost them in a tragic line of duty death. I hate to bring up traumatic times for you but if you were able to move on, and get past the dark times, I need you to come forward and help me help my friend. I don't want something bad to heppen to him and every day I get more and more scared that I'll wake up to a phone call saying he's gone too. So if you've lost a love one and we're able to push forward, please contact me ASAP. I would love for you to talk with my friend and help him. I think someone who's dealt with his same pain will be able to better counsel him through his grief the the shrinks and counselors now that just tell him to basically move on etc. Thank you for your time."
"Hi! This is my first time posting in this group and I am hoping to get some replies pertaining to a new anti-depressant I was prescribed. I have been on ADs/anxiety meds for around 15 years. I have been through many, many trials of meds. I have recently been given samples of Viibryd by my psychiatrist and am wondering what any of your experiences were/are with it. I am slowly weaning off my Sertraline (that I have been on for years) and I have a prescription for Xanax (.5mg) for an as needed basis. Any real life experiences you can share?"
"Don't usually write stuff like this but ...I've been pretty busy lately so I missed The chance to post on the mental health movement that bell worked on yesterday so I figure I'd throw my 2 cents in   I am so passionate about mental health and the way it's evolving ( for the better) at such what seems like exponential rate now . These issues hold a special place for me, not even for my mental health which hasn't been the issue but for those around me effected (affected idk what one to use )   The awareness exploration and research on these issues from PSTD to abuse to depression and anxiety and other mental disorders is so far ahead of how we used to treat diagnose and cure these problems . In the past we didn't have the technology to understand These disease processes and were (for the most part ) treating them with drugs and psychotherapy that was ineffective and sometime even dangerous .   NOW we have new studies new drugs new treatments that are not only more effective but in the cases like PTSD and abuse able to cure people . This is much like an example of new surgeries , 5 years ago a ACL tear was a career ending injury for a hockey player if gretzky tore his ACL there is a good chance he would never play ( or play at the level he did at that time) NOW new technologies and new techniques exist that didn't before and just 1 year ago kris visteege completely messed his knee up tearing a bunch of ligaments in his knee now after surgery treatment and new rehab therapy he is back playing as a top player in the NHL again after what would have been a life altering injury  I guess where I'm going with this is , we need to keep getting the awareness out there BUT also get the awareness out there that what some thought was unfixable or unable to cure or living life will always be this way Could be wrong. If there are people in your life that could need some help or a hand to hold onto keep convincing them that there is something they can do , that even if years ago you tried therapy and it didn't work to try again new stuff is out now.   I'll leave this crazy rant with a story ( I hope he doesn't mind) I helped my brother about 3 years ago come out to our family that he had depression , depression to the point where he had thoughts of killing himself everyday . This was a bombshell when we learned that not only he felt this way but that we had zero idea . We all banded together through some very tough sad and sometime frustrating times to help him go to therapy get on some antidepressants and he WORKED his ass off . He went to all his appointments , took all his meds, he studied his problems and when he had days where he couldn't take it or couldn't handle it he leaned on us , weather it be a text or a call or picking him up whatever it was we were there ( cause not only does the person have to do it themselves they need support ) when we weren't available he had crisis numbers to call and when all else failed and he had no one to reach out instead of making that other decision he called 9-1-1 to take him somewhere safe ( and as a person working on the ambulance I thank you for responding to those calls jay seem like nothing but a trip to the ER but for him and me sometimes it meant a lot more ) HE WORKED his ass off and put the time in .... fast forward 3 years, and he just yesterday got the grade back and finished his degree at the university it took longer but he did it, he is not clinically not depressed and has underlying anxiety and at the end of the month he is planning on cycling off his meds to see where he is at . I'm so proud of him and I'm so glad we could help in anyway, he is so strong and I couldn't be more happy how it all was handled , I hope this story could be the proof that while it seemed so dark and bad looking how far it's come it's inspiring    You OWE it to yourself to take that step and try and see , because I think if you do you may surprise your self"
"we're all in a state of dissaray i believe. it's just the lonely ones that fit are the one's who fit the criteria of mental disorder, as human nature favours social interaction. the so called normal people , they are surrounded by people, often many. take away those people who distract them from the harsh realities of life and you'll end up with a lost and confused individual, what do you think?"
"There was an amazing comic posted on Reddit not long ago, and I need to share it with my husband to explain acceptance of mental illness.   It was quite simple (paraphrasing, since I can't remember the exact comic): Panel 1: My mental illness then - a terrified woman being eaten alive by a dark cloud, screaming, What is happening!?  Panel 2: My mental illness now - a woman sitting at a kitchen table, dark cloud next to her, saying, oh hey there friend.  Please help! Could have sworn I saved it"

"The earliest memory I have (found through hypnotherapy) is of darkness and being hit in the face. I was always covered in bruises as a child (my mother told social services i enjoyed throwing myself down the stairs).  But the earliest memory feels very early, pre-verbal, and affects my life in that I have an innate feeling that people can be violent and hurt me. This is especially related to expressing myself (I was likely hit when I was crying to shut me up) which I find impossibly hard to do many times. Hard because in many social situations my brain freezes and I don't even know what I feel, what I'd like to say, who I am, nothing.. there's nothing there, I'm just stunned until the situation is gone.  Given this likely happened in the first year of life I'm almost giving up any chance of this abysmal fear/trauma ever going away..  My only way of coping with these things is writing songs about them so I wrote [this song here](https://soundcloud.com/mickeythedrama/a-dangerous-place).  Can anyone relate to this?"
"So, I've always had obsessive thoughts. But ever since this year I've stopped thinking of them and just think of nothing all day. It's strange because I've had obsessive thoughts all my life. I read a thread on Reddit where someone was complaining about them getting obsessed, which interested me. Someone on that thread said SSRIs stop obsession, and I saw that Prozac is an SSRI, do you think this caused my lack of interest in things I once enjoyed and made me stop having obsessive thoughts? Has anyone else experienced something like this? I figured this would be the best place to ask."
"I'm really damn pissed. I was playing Overwatch and was trying to get some lootboxes to get the rooster skins and whatever, and for the last 3 hours I got crappy teams (some were OK but the enemy team were really good). I got really angry and told my friend about it. He didn't help because he was acting like an asshole. In fact, he just made me more pissed. I want to get my anger out before I bicycle kick the screaming kids across the road from me with steel capped boots. And before you answer, don't tell me to exercise or do any calming crap like reading a book or listening to calming music. I AM THIS CLOSE TO PUNCHING A HOLE IN MY ESOPHAGUS WITH A BLUNT PENCIL.  Any helpful comments would be greatly appreciated  Thanks"
"I recently ended a relationship of three and a half years. I do not love him, I'm not sure if I ever did, and I literally don't feel upset at all. Might be dissasociation but I'm not sure. So I might care somewhere and not be able to tell. Anyway, when I met a new person it is very easy for me to divulge very personal things about myself and deeply connect with them, but now after multiple LTRs I realize that after a period of time I become secretive, closed off, self conscious, and insecure. Why am I like this? I feel like my feelings going through a reverse progression. Can anyone else shed some light on this or relate at all?"
"Hello Reddit! I am putting feelers out to see if anyone would be interested in using a site that I am thinking of creating. I want to create a site that contains informational resources for mental health issues, victims of abuse, and other related topics. This site would also contain a forum so that people can share their stories and chat with others on the various topics listed. I myself have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and am a victim of emotional abuse. I know their are many communities to connect with others and websites with helpful information for those seeking help. However, I have never felt completely satisfied with the communities I have found. I feel that it is hard to find a place with a sense of community and well as informational for those seeking help. Also, I would create the site to be an anonymous place where people feel safe, regardless of their situation to share and seek help. If this sounds like something that would be beneficial or if you would be interesting in being a part of that type of community, please leave a comment.  Thanks, wanderer6262"
I am weaning off Effexor after having been on for about two months. I had a little bit of brain fog/brain zap for one day. I have also been getting killer headaches around mid-day but I'm dealing with it okay. What's driving me insane is my ears ringing. Is this normal?!
"I just recently feeling socially isolated. I'm at my second semester of college and feel like I don't have anyone close. I don't have many close friends to begin with so talking to someone about my thoughts puts me on edge - like I don't feel comfortable doing so. I have a friend group but I don't know them on a deeper level yet. Tonight in particular, I feared social interaction and confrontation and I don't have any idea why. I put on my flannel and jacket and decided to walk 3 miles round trip. I live in Southern California so it wasn't freezing but it was windy. I listened to music and thought about my life and found myself so confused. I didn't know why I continued to walk nor why I cried. My mental health has never been the best but this was a shock even to me. I've always dealt with something but nothing to the point where I thought there was something wrong with me. I came back only because I friend asked me where I was - as I replied I don't really know. I ran into some friends in my dorm building and felt very anxious and I'm pretty sure they caught on. I just don't know how to access what just happened tonight but if someone could help that'd be great."
"2012 I had my first psychosis after being over religious for a while. I started to hear God's voice and one time I even thought that I was the Holy Spirit. 2013 I had the second psychosis. I was a zombie on the medicine I got and gained weight which sucks. In the end of 2016 I had my third and hopefully my last psychosis and it was hell. I saw colors in things and saw and heard spirits trying to possess me and I had not enough insight to know something was wrong so I was totally confused. I did not know that I had a psychosis and did not even quite understand that I was in a mental hospital. Things got really weird and I felt that the whole world around me was rotting or reset. At the same time I thought that the thousand year reign would begin - at least that it was time for a big change. I was feeling and seeing all these things, like I was being controlled and monitored, and that I had some kind of important role given by God but that I could not quite figure out what it was. Humor and better medicine for me than back in 2012 and 2013 saved me. I am well. But today, a depressed day and I would love to hear from someone who has been through the same hell as me."
"I donâ€™t know about everyone else, but when I am in a down mental state , I have a tendency to believe that my entire past has always been that way.  When I am depressed, I feel like I have always been depressed. When my anxiety levels are high, I feel like they have always been high.  In those moments, I struggle to even think that I will ever get better. Not only do I have to fight for the motivation to heal, but also for the belief that it is actually even possible to heal in the first place.  In order to combat this, I wrote for myself a â€˜mental health checklistâ€™ with the words under it saying: â€œthese have helped you in the past and they will help you againâ€  Then I list some things that have worked for me to get me to a better place. Typically they are things that force me out of my head and into the present.  EG: Exercise, Cold showers, Writing, Meditating as well as asking myself â€˜are my thoughts logical? And am I physiologically fine (eg: am I hungry/tired?).   This has helped me a bunch and it may for you.  To clarify, I am not saying to do what I do, rather find your own. Also, this is to help when my general mood drops/mental health issues play up â€“ like a mental health first aid. If something major happens I am straight to the psychologist.  I share this because it took me ages to realise that I could be taking steps to get better quicker, and I want to show others that as well  I talk about this in depth here (podcast talk): http://www.zachary-phillips.com/realitycheck/e011  I would love to know what you do to get yourself back to normality."
"Trying to find some relatively easy reading about giving up drinking, especially from a male perspective and the kind of questions that someone who identifies as male would have. Mainly looking for text that incorporates/includes reasoning behind giving up drinking alcohol, how to deal with situations where you may feel social pressure to drink.   Really appreciate anything you can point me at!"
"My parents are both at work; I have the house to myself. I bought the rope from a climbing goods shop, so it will be strong enough, it won't break. I don't want my mom to find me; she wouldnâ€™t be able to cope. My dad is strong though and I know he'll protect my mom from the worst of it.  So I take my rope to the garage, where he'll find me, and tie it around one of the beams in the ceiling. I climb up on a step ladder that I can kick away easily, and wrap the rope around my neck. I haven't left a note, there's nothing to say. I thought I might chicken out, I might have second thoughts, but now I'm up here I'm surer than ever. Confident even, that this will release me from the pain I've been feeling. I kick the ladder away.  At first it just hurts. More than I expected. I think I expected to just peacefully drift off, but there's nothing peaceful about this. Even though I'm content with my decision, my body has other ideas and it starts to convulse. I find my hands grasping at the rope, at my neck trying to create some space for air to pass. I can't stop them.  It feels less painful as the seconds pass and my vision gets blurry and tunnels. My thoughts race to memories I didn't know I had, but I can't focus on them; maybe they are trying to find something to change my mind, something to make me fight this. But there's nothing there. My life hasn't been terrible. I have loving parents who tried their best. I was never abused or anything. But there was nothing remarkable either, nothing I would miss. I'm just an average person in an average life, and it's not enough. In the next few seconds it stops hurting. I can't see the garage around me anymore, just black. I have a high pitched ringing in my ears and I can't feel my fingers or any part of me. I certainly can't move them. Even if I changed my mind, I was beyond the point of no return. Only a couple more seconds and I'm done with this life. Black, silence. I pass out.  I open what I think are my eyes, but when I try to look down at my body it isn't there. Nothing is there, just emptiness and darkness. A dimmer brings up the light and I'm in a square grey room, cold and silent. I still don't have a body, but I can look around. I spin to see if there is a way out. When my vision gets back to where it started, there is a desk, with me sitting behind it. I'm wearing red, I don't wear red.  What the fuck do you think you're doing? I shout at myself, there are people in this world who are really suffering; from war, famine, loss and they don't try and take the pussy's way out. And you, you fucking fairy, what's so bad about your life anyway? You have a family that loves you, a job, and a roof over your head. What's so terrible about that?  Before I can respond the desk is bigger, there is a second chair there now and a second me. I'm wearing blue.  You couldn't possibly understand. Blue Me says, turning to face Red Me. My life isn't some tragedy, some terrible drama, no. But it's something worse, it's unimportant. If I had some adversity in my life it may have taught me to fight, to carry on. But I don't. It feels like life is just happening to me, I'm not living it. Nothing feels important. So if I have nothing to fight against, nothing to fight for; what's the point?  I try to speak; I want to tell Red Me that he has no idea what he is saying. That just because you aren't suffering, doesn't mean you have anything to live for. But I can't speak, I can see and hear, but I can't speak. It seems like Blue Me gets it though.  I'm not in an abusive relationship, I am not a refugee, I haven't been attacked for my beliefs, I am not suffering a disability and I am not hiding childhood trauma. My life is perfectly average and normal. And apathy is driving me out of my mind. If all I have to look forward to in this life is going to work for forty years and then dying, I'd rather just skip the work part. Says Blue Me, seeming very tired.  But what about your parents? Screams Red Me. They will be crushed, devastated if you weren't around anymore. What about your friends who love you? All of their worlds would be darker if you weren't in them.  So you're only argument for me living is that it stops other people being sad? replies Blue Me. You didn't even argue that I make those people happy, just that it would make them sad if I died. So my life in itself has no value. It doesn't matter that I'm not happy, that my life is dull and painful to me. It doesn't matter as long as I don't upset other people. So my disappointment in the life I have, is less important than their sadness? Your argument is based around what's best for other people, not what's best for me.  It's not up to you anyway, or me, it's up to him. says Red Me as he looks down the longer table to a third seat. Sitting in the seat is me, but a Shadow Me. I can barely see him, but I know he's there. And when Shadow Me speaks, I don't hear him with my ears, I feel his words.   So you want to die? he says, it feels like he is looking into my mind as he stares at me with his shadow eyes. You are in pain, I can feel it. Being in pain is preventing you from feeling the good in the world. Blue is correct; nothing feels good in your life and nothing feels bad. It's left you with a feeling of nothingness. And what is the point in life if you feel nothing?  He looks down the table at Red Me, he is correct as well. Your life isn't terrible; you haven't suffered tragedy so there is always hope of repair. Your life is empty right now, but it hasn't always been and wonâ€™t always be. He brings up your friends and family, not because their feelings are more important than yours, but because once upon a time, their companionship made you happy. There has been no great rift; there is nothing that needs to be fixed. So there is hope that it can be enough again.  I find my voice for the first time in this place. I'm tired of feeling numb.  I know. Says Shadow Me, but you are capable of feeling. The mechanism may be damaged, but it is not completely broken. If you are in a beautiful garden and you hit your toe on a rock; all you feel is the pain and you no longer see the flowers. It doesn't mean the flowers are gone though, simply that you have lost the ability to see them. Once the pain subsides the flowers will return to view, and you will see beauty again. Your numb feelings and loneliness in this world are preventing you from seeing anything good, but it's a short term situation. The good things are still there and eventually you will remember how to see them, how to feel them.  Shadow Me looks at Red Me who simply nods in agreement. He looks at Blue Me who looks away.   It's settled then. says Shadow Me in a commanding voice and Red Me and Blue Me are no longer in the room. The table is small with one chair and in it sits me. Just me.  This might seem like the only way out... Complete Me says, But there is another way. You think we don't have anything to fight for but you're wrong. Fight for the fact that there are cool, beautiful, awesome things in this world that we haven't seen or experienced yet. Fight for your happiness, rather than accepting that it's gone forever. Fight.  Someone turns down the lights, the pain returns in my neck and now my back and my backside hurt as well. As my eyes start to regain their focus I can see the beam in the garage ceiling with half of the rope still tied to it. My numb hands reach for my neck, this time I want them to, and they find the other half of the rope. It snapped."
"I've always been into comic books, I have been since I was child I have a bookcase full of my constantly growing collection of graphic novels it's been my favourite escape for as long as I can remember. The other day I saw a graphic novel that really took my interest in a Waterstones, but decided I would leave it there for the time being because I've been short on cash being recent graduate with no job. A couple days later I ordered a pizza with my girlfriend and paid for it and in return for buying her food she offered to take me back to Waterstones and buy me the book using the discount she gets for working at another Waterstones elsewhere, I took her up on the offer and the next day (today as of writing this) we went to the Waterstones to pick it up... when we got there I saw a rather large bloke stood in the graphic novel section holding the only copy of the one I wanted, at first I was really annoyed but I browsed other sections of the shop waiting and hoping he'd put it back on the shelf... he did not, he bought it and left now this shattered my mood, my girlfriend offered to buy me a different graphic novel from the shelf as there were many that were needed for my collection, but I stood there totally disheartened and now didn't want any of the graphic novels on the shelf in front of me I wanted the one that that big bloke had taken from me. Now I'm from Wigan where men tend to pride themselves on being men and I was now furious at my self for being so childish and throwing an internal paddy over a fucking comic book, I felt like an idiot but no matter how hard I tried scanning the shelves for another option I couldn't escape the thought I don't want any of these I want that one! I told my girlfriend I no longer felt like getting one and we left as I walked down the street I literally had to fight back tears to stop my girlfriend from knowing that I a 21 year old man would be as stupid to get this upset over something so small, I cursed myself for forgetting to pack my anxiety medication for our trip (it was our anniversary the other day) I'm sorry for the long babbled post I just needed an outlet to get this off my chest and I didn't want to upset my girlfriend and ruin our anniversary trip. I'm sorry I'm so stupid."
When I have a shower I start having terrible thoughts and end up having a panic attack every time. I'm so scared of having a shower now that I haven't showered in 3 weeks. I know this is unhealthy/hygenic so I went for a swim in the ocean which helped. Unfortunately this is only a band-aid solution. Does anyone else have this problem? Do people have suggestions for how I can have a shower in happiness/peace? Thanks.
"I think my sister may have a mental problem. She is only 10(going to turn 11 in march.) but, she is driving me insane. Let me just give you a little background. I'm the oldest of 4 girls with our ages being 16, 12 (turning 13 in March) 10 (turning 11 in March), and 9. All the rest of us don't have any problems, except the twelve year old has mild O.C.D. And I get that little sisters can be annoying, but she is way past that. She is a nightmare.  My sister has narcissistic traits. She thinks she's more entitled to things than other people are. For example: We are currently in the middle of moving, and my dad offered to let whoever wanted to come live in the house early with him to come. He mentioned to my sister (we'll call her L) that if neither me or my other sister came then he would have to purchase her a cellphone. That way if she misses the bus to our new school she could call him. Well, in her mind that meant that she was entitled to the brand new IPhone 7 and she tried convincing my other sister not to come to the new house. An argument ensued between them to the point of L belittling my other sister into tears. Finally I butted in and asked L, So is a cellphone really more important than your own sister's happiness? She began screaming at me, MY HAPPINESS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER'S! I WANT THAT NEW IPHONE! SHE WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT! Now, we can by no means afford a brand new iPhone and she knows that. Hell, we can barely afford our house. I mean, yeah my parents and I have the 6s but we are in a 2 year contract. My other sister has a 5s, but only because our grandpa died. Whenever the subject of a cellphone comes up she ends up screaming and belittling people every time.  L can never be wrong either. Or take criticism. If we try to correct her on something it ends up in a screaming match with someone getting hurt. If we tell her that she did a math problem wrong, she'll argue for hours on end with us about how she did it right. Then once you do prove her wrong, if by the rare chance she accepts it, she'll lie and say that we were wrong the whole time. If I tell her that I have homework to do or a book to read, she'll claim she's already done that type of math and it's easy or that she's already read that book a thousand times. When I call her out on it she screams at me. It's never ending with her.  L lies a lot and is lazy. She lies to make herself seem better than other people and to seem innocent. She hit my younger sister and when my mom yells at her for it she denies it. Even though L did it right in front of her eyes. She'll often try to twist stories around and thinks that constantly repeating a command will make you do it. Like when we were on a rode trip and she wanted the front seat. I had been sitting there for about 30 mins and she asks me if I want to switch seats. I told her no. She then started repeating. Switch me seats. Switch me seats. Switch me seats. For about 15 mins. After I ignored her the whole time she proceeded to yell in my face, YOU WILL SWITCH ME SEATS! I calmly told her if she got in my face again she'd loose her teeth. That shut her up real quick.   What happened today is what made me write this. This incident made me think she has a real problem. While I was grabbing something to eat, she slammed a perfectly good apple on the ground. When I asked her why she did that she, of course, denied it. I told her I saw her do it right in front of my eyes. She got in my face and screamed, IT ROLLED OFF THE COUNTER YOU IDIOT!!! I told her she had 2 seconds to get out of my face. She then proceeded to hit me in the face. And what happened next, I'm not very proud of. I usually walk away, but this really drew the line for me. I smacked her into tomorrow. That hurt my hand. She was kinda stunned for a second then she pushed me into the wall. I grabbed her hair and started beating her. At the time, I was so mad I didn't know what I was doing. My grandmother had to pull me off of her. She didn't cry until my grandmother got there. Then L tried to lie and said that I hit her in the face first for no reason. And now that I think about it, I'm glad that I beat the crap out of her. I know a 16 year old beating up a 10 year old sounds bad, but I'm done with her bull crap. I'm tired of L beating on my 9 year old sister because she is smaller. But, when I step up to her, she turns into a coward.   I don't know what to do with her anymore. Neither do my parents. They've tried spankings, groundings, and pretty much anything. Nothing has worked. I came to this subreddit because, I thought you guys would know what's wrong with her. I think she has a mental problem."
"Quick summary: Scientist, in a highly regulated environment, living with clinical depression and anxiety. Medicated: Sertraline, 75mg/day, taken by alternating taking 1 and 2 50mg tablets a day. Have been on this regime for years, but I can be terrible at remembering to take my meds.  Newish in my company, but came in as an experienced scientist. Have made a couple of mistakes that have resulted in a shit ton of paperwork and large formal what went wrong, why, what can we do, what will we do procedures. Nothing too major and it was all picked up timely as is procedure but they were largely due to lapses in memory/focus on my part.  It's getting noticed by my higher ups (who were nice about it) and quite frankly I've noticed a decrease in performance myself. I do try, promise, but when making a conscious effort to focus my band of focus can be quite narrow, and I inevitably miss out bits of a procedure I should also follow.   I've also noticed an increase in quirks at home: aversions to touch with certain types of fabrics (also can't stand when SO drags his bare or socked feet on our rugs or carpets), aversions to sounds (metal on ceramic, something that was on at a normal volume then becoming painful to listen to), etc.  I've noticed my memory getting slowly worse over the past year and I'm not sure if it's a by - product of the mentalness, side effect of Sertraline, mild withdraw whenever I miss said Sertraline, or something else entirely. Or if I'm wide off the mark and I have no real decrease in memory and focus, and I just have it in my head that I do.  I don't even know if this is worthy of bothering my GP. I can never quite articulate what goes on in my head well until I have tangible episodes.  Thoughts? Experiences? Is this a genuine thing I can bother my doc about or is it all (for want of a better phrase) in my head?"
"We all are quite aware that depression sucks. I hurts mentally and physically. It can take everything away and make life monotone. It can look like a bright smile or an emaciated stare. It's all unique.   Sometimes, it is made worse by those we love the most. Not everyone can understand how depression feels. The isolation of being depressed can't be empirically validated.   When you have a loved one that can't accept that you are different from them, it creates an insurmountable wall. When someone is raised not to share their feelings or fears, it's even worse. The walls are so high, that moments of happiness just seem like illusions put out by people manipulating you for their own ends.   From nurture, walls are built to shape a person's reality. It becomes solitary confinement of the mind and spirit.  Any misstep or glance over this wall is met with contempt and abuse. Through operant conditioning, the individual in question learns not to dream, disagree or rebel. Everything that they know tells them that they will lose everything, and they will be less than the nothing they felt they were before.   Real emotional abuse can turn into self abuse, strengthening the cycle of self loathing and mental reliance on others. Every word from another's lips becomes life or death. Positive feedback only pulls someone through for a passing moment. Negative feedback carries for days, weeks, months, years...  This is what twenty or more years of constant mental abuse can do to a person. It is made more painful when diagnosable physical and hormonal needs are never treated.   Friends leave, or do not want to understand because of their own personal needs. No one can be trusted, because when the issues are discussed, it's suddenly an attack on them. It becomes all their fault, because you can't normally talk about these things until it is making every joint in your body ache.   Thus, with silence do the isolated live their lives."
"It's not surprising to me, but I recently had the sudden realization that I've developed trust issues and it's affecting my ability to connect with people. I'm a person that genuinely believes that people almost never try to be cruel, and are generally looking out for their own interests (as we all should be within reason). But somewhere along the way, I seemed to have lost the 'spark' I used to have when meeting people and connecting with my friends. Anybody have experience with this? Yes, I'm going to therapy, next appointment is in 3 weeks. Advice, general or personalized is appreciated.  Background:  I'll try to keep this short, just wanted to provide some context. 30/M. I have depression, which I'm sure factors into it. It's definitely affecting me right now but I've been doing a great job of keeping myself busy and not dropping too low. Over the last 6 years or so, I've had a long string of instances where close friends of mine have ghosted/semi-ghosted on me seemingly out of nowhere. It's something I'm sensitive to, but until recently it hasn't affected my ability to connect with new people.  The last year in particular was especially hard, with...  *Best friend of ~8 months more or less stopped talking to me. When we started actually talking-talking we had a serious conversation about these issues I've had in the past, and she expressed having similar issues and vehemently agreed with me that communication was key. Made 3 very strong attempts to talk to her about what was going on before eventually giving up. Later found out she was overwhelmed and depressed, but she basically ignored me for 4 months.  *New friend I got close to, really hit it off with after a month or so. 4 months later, she moves halfway across the country. Absolutely the right decision for her and I don't begrudge her moving  *New person I started dating for about 3 months started withdrawing, eventually said she couldn't date right now because of some (genuinely life-consuming) external circumstances. Basically said that if in a few months I was still interested she'd still like to see me. Did so a few months later, she recently started dating someone else. Long story short I know for a fact that she didn't break up with me to date the other guy.  *Another new friend, wasn't super close - moved about 3 hours away after being friends for ~6 months."
I will be dying soon due to a terminal illness. I'm trying to come to grips with it. Is there life after death?
"So yesterday I started a Wellbutrin prescription @ 300mg.   I've taken my dose for the day, and the strangest thing is that I feel a noticeable improvement of mood already. The only way I can describe it is that I feel like a depressive fog has been lifted, and I can see clearly again for the first time in months. Is this just a placebo effect? What may be going on here?   Also, for those of you who have extensive experience taking Wellbutrin, what should I know going into it that my psychiatrist may not inform me about, or may just be lesser known in general? What should I expect over the next few weeks? Thanks in advance, everything is appreciated."
"I feel sad most days and I cry most days just because I feel so overwhelmed. I am easily irritated by small things, like my dogs licking my hand out of no where or my boyfriend trying to play around (for example, tickling me). Then I overreact by snapping leave me alone or quit it. I can't seem to laugh. I don't clean anymore, I have to make myself shower. I only volunteer to be around certain people, and even then it's only a short time before I feel like I have to get away. I know part of it is that I've put on a lot of weight in the past two years and I feel disgusting. Another thing is I feel miserable whenever I'm at work - stressed out and cynical, and like I can't muster up any compassion at all. I'm a nurse coming up on my one year anniversary and I've been in patient care for four years so this is a serious problem. I've thought that if I change careers maybe I will be better but I don't know if I'm feeling this because I'm depressed or if it's contributing to the problem. My boyfriend and I barely have sex and only if I initiate, which I don't even want to anymore because I just feel so disgusting, like a blob of grease and fat sitting in a pile of dirt. I feel stupid and say things I know were dumb the minute I say them. I'm having a really hard time mustering up the will to lose weight and take better care of myself. And I don't want to make a permanent change in my career because I don't know if it will make any difference. Can someone please give me some advice on how I can be a functional, at least semi-happy human being again? I stopped taking my birth control two months ago and I've noticed I'm not taking four hour naps on top of ten hours of sleep at night &amp; I'm not eating two pints of ice cream plus whatever else I can get on my hands on in a day. But I still don't feel right if that makes sense.  Five years ago I was running 5Ks, lifting weights at the gym, and doing yoga. I ate a strict, healthy diet and I felt good. I still had some low periods out of the blue, something I've always suffered with, but it was manageable. I was never Barbie, but I did make an effort to dress in a way I thought looked good. I was 21, making minimum wage &amp; had no idea what to major in for college but I felt less stressed and definitely happier."
My friend was raped by her dad when she was little and ever since then she has always complained of having a demon. But this demon is basically her concise and it almost controls her emotions. She's said in the past that its almost like someone is looking over her shoulder. I don't know how to help her or even what's causing this and I just need some help.
"Hi everyone!  For the life of me, I can't remember if I saw this post on /r/mentalhealth or /r/bpd... or maybe on a different subreddit altogether.  Pretty much it was an article discussing a disorder (or syndrome?) when people inconsistently take their meds. For example, they would take meds for months, or years, then abruptly stop for no reason. This relates a lot to me, and I would like to bring it up with my Psychiatrist tomorrow... I just thought it would help if I could put a name to it.  Thanks for all your help! I greatly appreciate it.  Edit: Just saw this post says it's an announcement. How can I change it? Sorry, I'm a newbie."
"Hello, I would like to read some stories of paths people took to getting help for depression, SAD, PMS, PMDD or any other closely related diagnosis I don't know about. I have never been seen by a mental health professional but many days wonder if it would be helpful. I also have no idea where to begin and worry that I could potentially spend a lot of money see a lot of doctors or therapists and simply be deemed, fine, or be told it's all in my head."
"Okay so I'm dx c-ptsd, and possibly bipolar or borderline (Drs not sure yet!) I exhibit all borderline symptoms just not enough at one time for long enough? IDK i trust her judgement though and we just focus on my symptoms not so much the label....  Anyways lately I've really noticed that I get WAY too excited about things... like tonight I have plans to go see some bands with my friend and I feel so hyper just thinking about it and I have actually been sweating all day because my heart rate is so high. I LOVE going out and looking good (I feel extra confident when this happens). Does this happen to anyone else?  I've been this way my whole life but I think it's become a not so good thing as I get older... like I get really impulsive when I feel like this. Usually drink too much, do drugs, cheat, I'm an incredible flirt.  I'm mostly just wondering why this happens and what it is.... I see my doc soon so I will talk to her but idk how to calm myself down in the meantime!"
"A long time ago, I struggled with some sort of mental affliction that I can only compare to multiple personality disorder. I am very curious as to what exactly I experienced, and I'm looking for some answers. The first sign was when I was a little kid, probably as young as 3 years old. Every so often I would feel as though I sensed some kind of change within my brain. As if my neurochemistry became shuffled every few months.   The next significant event I can remember is, one day I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep when the strangest realization hit me, right around a time when I was beginning to deal with some depersonalization: How do I know that my consciousness as it exists now, will still exist tomorrow when I wake up? How do I know that 'I' will wake up in my body tomorrow? How do I know that every night, my brain doesn't completely reset? How do I know that I'm the same 'me' after I wake up? Is it possible that I just think I'm the same person I was yesterday?  I then began to develop a phobia of falling asleep. I was already suffering with extensive mental illness at the time. Then, one day, I woke up and it wasn't me.  I had all of my memories. I remembered my relationships with people, but I felt no emotional attachment. I remembered my likes and dislikes, but they were meaningless to me. I remembered the things I had been thinking about the day before, but I did not identify those things as my thoughts. It was like looking through an entirely different lense of emotions. Then, over time I started to have difficulty remembering all of these things. I had a genuine fear of losing myself on a very literal level.  This may have been my dissociation, I'm not entirely sure, but at some point I would have these rushes of emotions flooding through my head, like racing thoughts x10, and they would last for hours. I did not recognize these emotions as my own, and I was very confused as to why I was feeling them. My mental fortitude began to shatter, and suddenly, I had become something called arcaes. It's not like he had a voice of his own. He was me, and I was him, but when I was him, his emotions were the only thing that mattered to me. That's a poor way of describing it, but it's the closest I can get.  Arcaes spoke in eloquent poems which I could not normally write. He was something like a sociopath. He had no concern for my friends. He had no concern for my reputation. In front of my mom, he/I would pretend I was normal. At school, he would constantly display narcissistic thoughts like Everyone around me is completely retarded. They may as well be slugs. despite my extremely low self esteem. When he came around, I could feel the dopamine flowing through my brain as if I were on drugs or something. It was like his emotions took priority over mine. I was still there, watching all of this, but I was incapable of opposition.  I am the type of person who was always painfully overly empathetic. For example when I was a little kid, I would cry every time I accidentally stepped on a bug. Arcaes, however, had different ideas. Before I conquered this illness of mine, I attempted a murder-suicide (thank goodness I failed). That was when I realized that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with me. I went to a mental hospital and lied to the doctors. I decided I would have to deal with this on my own. Through trial and error I discovered no amount of therapy would help this grave glitch my brain seemed to latch onto. I was able to cure myself through meditation and intense self-reflection, among other things. Does anyone have any idea what in the world happened to me?"
"So.....To me my biggest problem in life is being able to fit into modern society.I try to become friends with people who like what I like and all of that BUT...I have a problem. I have been diagnosed with social anxeity and depression.whenever I am out in public,I feel like I loose all sense of direction and feel like everyone is watching my every move and I panic that in I will mess something up and for somereason, i can never Comprehend everything peoplease say to in public either,I either just nod or laugh when I didn't understand what the other person said.Now,I don't seem to have this problem around close family members but only when meeting new people or just generally out in public.(someone please tell me what this is so I can try to resolve this,it's part of my resolution).Another thing,when I am sitting in college and hear everyone else talking to people,I get discouraged in my head and start calling myself useless and a failure because I have no friends at all and i can hardly initiate a conversation with anyone let alone keep it going. I also only leave the house for work,school,appointments etc.but when I do try to go out,I just can't force myself to start conversations or stop myself from feeling useless in public.Please list some things below you would do or suggest to me, in order to hopefully improve.Feels good to just...rant and let out your worries like this so,thanks for reading!"
"I am a 16 year old male, and I feel like my morality is dying. I have a sense of morality, as well as a conscience, but it feels as if it is losing influence over me. Sometimes I have dark thoughts, and immediately hate myself for it, but they can get stuck in my head. I feel like a monster. I also am losing interest in things that I was very interested in as recently as New Years, and nothing has filled the void. I never feel like this in social situations, probably because I am distracted.  For background, I am not depressed, and feel happy a lot. I am not delusional, and do not hallucinate. I sometimes feel more paranoid than I used to, but I am usually able to mentally write these off as irrational. I am very social, and don't have social anxiety. I am not particularly stressed, or at least no more than I usually am, which is about a normal amount for a high schooler taking advanced classes. I am an atheist and do not believe in religion, but I am open to the idea.   I feel like I've gone almost numb to bad and evil things, and it's making me feel like I'm evil. Am I just being a hypochondriac and this is totally normal? Am I just a cynic? Am I messed up?"
"I saw /u/davedy4 post a thing he wrote while in a mental place, so I thought maybe i should put mine here as well.  (21/3/16)First day They took everything on my person except for my clothes. [i wasnt aloud any shoelaces or hoodie strings. THEY CUT THEM OUT MAKING MY PANTS LOOSE AS FUCK] and ran a budget metal detector over me. i didnt drink or eat anything and they wouldnt let me do aything until i ate something. and i seriously wasnt eating anything on the first day because i just got moved to a totally new location and i was uncomfortable. anyway they made me drink a thing called a strawberry nutrients suppliment. [tasted like strawberries [which i hate unless its an actual berry, not in milk or anything] and tasted like the smell of rotten eggs and chicken] every little sip i took [like about as much as a fingernail amount of liquid] made me almost throw up.  that night i was introduced to my bed. a mattress about as thick as a pizza box and it had no springs in it. it was a long night needless to say.  (22/3/16)Second day i started talking and getting to know the people. most of them were 14-17 years old. there was an 18 year old girl that got the attention of 3 security guards because she went spastic because she said im 18 im an adult you cant keep me here! when actually they could because she was involuntarily put in there by a judge or psychiatrist who thought she was a danger to society. i was a voluntary person [because my parents ticked the wrong box on the form by mistake, which got me a bunch of extra privileges. for some reason the staff didnt give me these privileges all the time [like going on walks around the hospital in the morning, going to the cafe, and requesting to be let out of various classes and activities for a while]   (23/3/16)Day 3, i was introduced to the school/education system in the ward, i can sum it up for you in 2 words. Card Games. I am also told i can call my family/friends while im in there, all phone calls [to and from] the ward are recorded, i decide its best i make new friends in hear who i can talk to without being recorded.  (24/3/16)Day 4, i hear rumors and talk around the ward about a secret menu for lunch breakfast and dinner, including chicken nuggets and noodles. [other than that is was vegetables and mash [and a bit of [i think it was meatloaf, it was meat of some sort] if you're lucky] every night.  (25/3/16)Day 5, i am taking a piss, when a nurse walks in on me and calls me out thinking im wanking and alerts the other staff. no one believes me when i tell the truth.  (26/3/16)Day 6, a new staff member appears that ive never seen before, he is african, with a strong accent, when i go for a shower he says he has to watch me to make sure i actually wash myself and not waste water. i make a complaint to the other staff before i go for a shower and they dont see a problem with it, even though no other staff has ever mentioned this rule to me, nor enforced it. I have no shower that day.  (27/3/16)Day 7, First week is over, i wonder how long i'll be in here. One of the boys goes out for visitation with his father [who looked like a wife beater]. he comes back 5 hours later limping on 1 foot, he says that he pulled a muscle going down stairs, the staff believe him. 5 minutes later him and his friends go into the courtyard [about a 5x5 meter area outdoors with walls maybe 6 or 7 meters high, you can see it on google maps.] and he takes off his shoe and stops limping, i stay at the door and watch through the window because i know somethings up. Lo and behold he's got some of the good bush, him and his friends toke it up and i get so fucking jealous. everyone but me was this guys friend so i was the only one indoors. and all the other were outdoors [4 including the guy that smuggled the weed in] and one of the staff notices me looking out into the courtyard and asks why i dont join them. i got really worried and didnt want the nurse to notice the smoking so i just said said idk, the tv is messing up can you take a look at it? to distract her, she takes the bait and turns the tv on with the remote, finding out nothing is wrong. i said i was just tired and wasnt thinking straight. then another nurse comes out of the watchtower [as we called it, basically an office where the staff had computers and filing cabinets and a staircase to a lower level all behind a thick layer of plastic or glass] and walks outside for some fresh air. RED LIGHTS BLARING IN MY HEAD because i was thinking that if a nurse went out there, caught them, i was the only one inside, i was the snitch, i would be the whistleblower, i didnt want them to think of me as something im not. i went to my room quickly and pulled out a crossword book i bought at the newsagents next to the cafe the day before, to look occupied, too occupied to snitch. i hear the courtyard doors open and i brace for impact from the other people. suddenly a nurse says why do you have a lighter, and smell like smoke? suddenly one of the girls break down and runs into her room with the lighter, starts burning her wrists and crying. the other teens and there rooms get a shakedown and the nurses find nothing. they are treated like children and dont get dinner. BOY THAT WAS A LONG DAY  (28/3/16)Day 8, Today we watched the first harry potter movie, the bourne identity and divergent, or insurgent, whatever the first one is called, not much happened today.  (29/3/16)Day 9, i am offered some sort of electroshock therapy, it was something supposedly relaxing that included electricity, but you had to strip down in front of 3 nurses and stay naked on a mattress looking thing for like an hour. i never decided to try it.  (30/3/16)Day 10, It's easter weekend, the nurses have hidden paper baskets of chocolate eggs around the ward, HOW SAD IS IT IN THAT WARD? EVERYBODY SAW THE BASKETS AND NO ONE ATE/TOOK ANY OF THE CHOCOLATE [not even me but still, when do you find a teen/kid who doesnt take free chocolate?]....  later I find a shiv behind a loose wall panel, i decide i best leave it there and not get into more trouble than i need to. but i do tell the most Troubled, shall we say? kid, so i can hopefully see something exciting happen. the shiv had a metal blade, and a plastic i think it was, for a handle held together with the classic all purpose duct tape. real prison style. At lunch i hear other people [who have been going in and out of this place for the past few years] talking about sarah coming back. they talk of staying in their rooms and treating her like royalty, i am slightly unnerved by the sound of her, and how the other are congregating to treat her as the queen.  (31/3/16)Day 11, it's her, Sarah.... She is very erratic and random with her behavior, rapid mood swings. At lunch she says she likes my hair and wants to pet it sometime, i give her my thanks and tell her she is free to do anytime.  Day 11 NIGHT, i am woken to yelling, banging and screaming, i immediately think someone got the shiv and went skitzo, i sneak out of my room down the hall below the windows of the watchtower, Sarah broke a wooden door off of its hinges, and broke the deadbolt off of it. the door was like an inch and a half wide. it's best not to anger sarah, she runs into the hall and one of the guards charges her and tranquilizes her [shit they can do that!? i dont want to be tranquilized fuck that, i make a b-line back to my room and try to sleep]  (1/4/16)Day 12, i walk past the blue room [a room, nothing but a door and a small window. cement floor, nothing more, nothing less] and see sarah in there, she whispers to me through the door asking me to push button to open the door [for a mental ward i was surprised it wasnt guarded] i told a lie and said that a security guard was down the door and i would come back later to release her. she trusts me. a security guard releases her about 40 minutes later and he has 4 other guards escorting her outside the building. she doesnt return for the rest of the day.  (2/4/16)Day 13, i am made aware she has been transported to The Martyr, from what ive been told its a full on asylum, padded rooms, straight jackets and the sort, apparently for the past year she has never been home, shes been continuously changing between the 2 mental hospitals.  (3/4/16)Day 13, I am in the courtyard and notice a loose wooden board over the window and inquire the nurses about it, apparently a kid a long time ago through a basketball at the window [which led into the hall and into the rest of the hospital which made it an easy escape route], i wouldve loved to try and escape just to feel the rush, the adrenaline of trying to taste freedom, but i already had the privilege of going to the cafe during the day, and walks in the car park in the morning.  (4/4/16)Day 14, i walk to the cafe with a nurse as an escort [that was the catch of being able to go on these walks through the building] SHE WONT LET ME BUY AN ENERGY DRINK NOT EVEN A COFFEE. I settle for an apple juice. when i get back i am surprised to see my parents in the ward talking to a psychiatrist, they have arranged for me to go home so i can go to court for the avo they put on me.  its a 5 and a half hour drive home. i am happy to get my phone back. i see my old preschool teacher at a mcdonalds on the way home, they just came back from the easter show in sydney, they entered a chicken contest thing. i get home and my dog is ecstatic to see me. i am home. i am free. but i do not forgive my parents for what they've done. I feel like this is only the beginning.   (28/1/17) So that's it. The avo got erased from my record on a good behavior bond back in november, life is still difficult and confusing, but i'm pulling through somehow.  EDIT: While i was there I saw about 20 different people, and like 90% of them were lgbt, which made me really sad.  EDIT 2: After thinking about my stay there and what happened for a few hours last night I do remember, when the seasons change i get bloody noses like every 2 hours, in Autumn and Spring, I was in there mid autumn-ish. The cleaners found blood in the sink and on the floor in my bathroom area that was connected to the room itself via a door. They alerted the staff and i was put under surveillance until i could prove it was a bleeding nose [which wasn't that hard, as i said, very often in autumn, but still annoying nonetheless]."
"My girlfriend has depression, anxiety and, PTSD.   She goes through cycles of being fine for weeks or months then she'll stop eating (her losing weight is the first sign shit is about to go downhill), she'll either sleep all day or barely sleep at all because of night terrors , stop leaving the house, she'll start getting paranoid and then she goes into a deep depression where she can barely function but she won't go to therapy until she hits rock bottom and every time rock bottom is deeper.  Every time I have to force her to go back to therapy but as soon as she feels better she quits. She has a 5y/o daughter, we have a 1 y/o son and she is pregnant. She recently started therapy and was recommended for inpatient care. She has done that before (before we met) and doesn't want to again. Mentally she is in bad shape right now she barely sleeps and when she does she has night terrors, she has panic attacks, she doesn't eat and weighs less then 100lbs. It's gotten to the point I don't want to leave her alone because I'm worried she'll kill herself.  I am completely drained I'm working and in school and this is starting to affect my grades and job. She's getting worse and I think I can help her. I need advice."
"Besides meditation, are there exercises which I can practice to be in tune with my own emotions?"
"Most days, my partner will take her pills when she needs to. But some days she refuses. When i tell her she needs to take them, she says its only so people can stand her. Honestly, I don't know what to say to that. She has DID, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Usually she is just in a depressing mood. What do I say to her when she refuses to take her pills?"
"I have severe OCD and anxiety. One of my obsessions that I've had for only a few years is that I'm actually dead and the world around me isn't real. This obsession comes and goes, usually more when I'm trying to sleep or study. Sometimes mentions of death or computer simulation trigger it, but I'd rather live in a matrix with everyone else. I fear I'm dead and alone in a fake reality.   I get depressed and have fantasies about suicide (I'd never do it though). My other OCD symptoms are bad, I rip my hair out constantly and pick at my face. I don't think my meds help and I don't know what to do.   Please, advice?"
"My mother just had her gallbladder removed this week and the way my father handling all of these situation got me worrying. Just FYI, he is compassionate, nice, thoughtful man but he sometimes seems like he has 0 control of his actions. He worries too much for almost irrational stuff. And he doesnt realize or convince he has a behavior disorder of some kind of at least. I tried to talk to him and get his attention and thought we made some process but he keeps falling in the same situation of short-timed worrying and anger.   During this time, my mother feels 0 support from him. Because he always worrying things or seems like helpless and miserable for no reason. It is quite exhausting for us to see him behave like that.  I think meditating and breating could help but his mind is so blocked that its hard to convince him to do all these.   I will answer every question and I do not know what to do to help.   Thanks."

"I have been going through a good patch the last few months where I no longer feel suicidal and my anxiety has been mostly under control. However, lately my anxiety is getting worse again. Whenever I worry about something more than is healthy or productive I get scared that I will end up back in that dark place, which of course, only makes the worrying worse: What if I never get better? What if I'll never be happy? What would happen if I'm always alone? Could anyone care about me when I'm like this? Am I just a burden on the people I am open with? This then triggers more depressive thoughts: What's the point if I'll never get better? Wouldn't it be easier to end this now? And I end up back where I started.   So I'm wondering does this cycle happen to other people? If so, do you have any suggestions on how to reduce the fear of 'relapsing'?"
"I have a simple microphone I use to record myself for random projects and whatnot. For a while, I tried to experiment with audio diaries as a form of self-therapy. Nothing fancy or anything like that. I just would record myself for a little bit and talk about how my day went.   For what it is worth, it helped. Obviously, everyone's mileage will vary. For good days, it was all right just to say that I enjoyed what happened. For bad days, it felt great to vent.  However, personally, I stopped doing them because it was not the same as just talking to another person in some shape or form. It is not like anyone is ever going to hear my audio diaries, but I just concluded they were not for me. Nothing beats just getting something off of your chest, especially when you are talking with a close friend or family member.  Has anyone else tried to do audio diaries? If so, how did it go?"
"Hi, I've been depressed for probably about 10 years, basically since I was a teenager (I put it in quotation marks because I've been to a GP/therapist a couple of times to discuss this issue but none of them gave me a solid diagnosis. Just saying I scored high on their tests). It's had a pretty massive impact on my life, but for some brief stints I was able to forget about it slightly and actually get on with something. As such I got through university and got a reasonable job that I enjoy. However it's been about a year and a half now since I graduated, and I think the routine and monotony of working life is starting to bring it back. I can feel myself slipping into the same patterns that I was in when I was 17 and had quite literally no interest in life.  Now frankly, I don't care that much about my 'happiness', or well-being, or any of that shit. I'm fine with living in reasonable comfort (which I have now), get better at what I do, and hopefully shimmy off this mortal coil at some point in my 30s. The problem is I can tell my mind is starting to weaken as a result. I'm not learning things at the same rate I used to. I plateau quite often and find myself unable to break through a particular problem for days at a time. This is pretty weird for me and it has me concerned that it will be a downward trend towards being kind of useless. Now honestly as a 20-something guy I find that pretty unacceptable. I need independance, and I literally cannot comprehend how shit it would be to not be able to support myself.   So as the title says, how do I deal with this? I'm not interested in 'feeling good within myself' or any of that trash. Just want to be able to stay sharp.  Cheers  - I did not intend for this to get tagged with announcement! Sorry!"
"What do you guys think of this movie? It came out in 1999, I just saw it and it made me cry a bit but I really do like it."
"Hi guys So after god knows how long of searching the internet trying to find out whatever the hell is wrong with me, I found reddit. I've seem some posts where people have been very helpful, so I was hoping I could get some help too. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, more to just get on a better track for research of my own mind. If you know what these symptoms might relate to, I'd appreciate some feedback.  MEGA LIST:  - Low empathy: Limited empathy only existent for the very few people I enjoy - Very violent, bad thoughts around the clock, but I don't feel particularly disgusted by them - Very violent urges and impulses. I don't feel bad about these either, but they are very hard to control. - Very few morals: My knowledge of right and wrong is more external boundaries than internal beliefs. Ex: the only thing stopping me from acting on impulses is the fact that people around me wouldn't like that. - Obsessions and compulsions (I have OCD) - Constantly thinking stuff like If I just killed myself I wouldn't have to do ____ accompanied by a brief yet overwhelming wave of depression. - Maladaptive daydreaming - I don't care about other people but I do care about how they perceive me. - Very undecisive, strong second opinions are my best friend. - I have done MINOR stealing in the past, but not recently (i was with a friend, but i didn't have a problem doing it) - I have been manipulative in the past because I thought it was funny (with a friend, but no problem doing it. the friend just helps my confidence) - Low self confidence and esteem - General anxiety, but few physical symptoms - I have dealt and I am currently dealing with depression. - Very mixed and fluctuating opinions of those closest to me - I do think that people talk about me behind my back - My mood swings rapidly over the course of one day. - I would likely not manipulate someone if someone didn't back me. - Just to repeat, my actions are highly influenced by those around me. It's not that I do certain things because people influence me to, it's more of how would they act if I did this? - I grew up in a dysfunctional household - I don't act narcicisistic. - I tend to dislike most people. - I probably wouldn't act very drastically to keep someone close to me.   Okay, if you survived that entire list, I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks."
"Hi. I'm in a very big need of talking to a professional, but I keep having these feelings. I'm afraid that if I am too open and tell everything I'll get diagnosed with something. I've always been a happy kid with good health, both physically and mentally. I started to feel bad in my teenage years (I'm 19 atm), and I'm pretty sure I have both depression and dp/dr. I wouldn't mind being diagnosed with that, since it feels like you can cure it. What I'm afraid of is that I'd be diagnosed with something else, and this kind of keeps me from getting in contact with a therapist. Is this a common thought? What should I do?"
"So I saw my doctor, she is referring me to a therapist and putting me on 10mg of prozac a day. I've never taken antidepressants before, is there anything i can expect? Just looking for people's experiences."
"I'm a 24 year old guy and for as long as I can remember I've been a disaster around any kind of situation where I need to socialise.  I try to fit in but It just all feels forced and terrible, I freeze up, I retreat into myself where I dont even notice the time passing and then at my worst times I just want to scream and curl up Into a ball. I have a history of anxiety and have taken things for it in the past but that never helped how I am around people.  I don't make friends easily and don't keep them very well either.  Just feeling very frustrated with myself as I often do after a moment like this."
"They went voluntarily to get a psychiatric evaluation, but I'm starting to worry since I haven't heard from them in 2 hours. If it were just a simple evaluation, wouldn't it have been done by now? Is it possible that even though they checked themselves in they would get put in a ward anyway without the family being informed? Should I call?  What should I expect in general?  I really want to talk to someone about this in my friend circle, but I don't want to share this kind of sensitive info to people we know and I'm feeling super alone in general about this."
"Hey guys :)  My mum has some serious problems in my opinion, not trying to make fun of her but I really want to help her.   She didn't have the best childhood and after that some other traumas happened that seem to have affected her.   She usually seems very detached and distant. Her two chronic diseases may be a reason for that as well, she is constantly afraid of causing pain with a motion. She has little to no self-confidence. Moreover, she recently told me she hears two people discussing with each other. I am not a professional but this doesn't sound healthy to me. Additionally, she is easily distracted and lacks concentration. She overeats and overspends, she has trouble setting boundaries. Most of the time it's impossible to have a proper conversation with her, she sometimes seems a bit childish (selfish, can't take on responsibility, talks about herself only,..). When I tell her she needs to get help as kindly as I possibly could, she nervously laughs it off, feels ashamed (of needing help? Being flawed? Idk) or at worst she starts crying. I could add more symptoms but I guess it isn't really necessary.  How can I make her actually want to go to therapy? I tried by saying she will be happy (have never seen her happy), she will lose weight, be able to afford nice vacations, become more concentrated, which really annoys her now.   Thanks to everyone, having to see my mum suffer makes me feel kinda desperate"
"I'm new to this subreddit so I apologize for this being somewhat political. Watching Trump be inaugurated and the following week have been traumatizing for me. I am already a fearful person, but with the constant barrage of crises and bad news, well, I feel my mental health plunging. I feel myself stuck in this fear and blackness and I don't see hope. I am afraid and I am afraid for my mental health in a way that I haven't felt for a long time. I imagine I'm not the only one who feels this way. How are you caring for yourself at this time? Do you have tips for how I can care for myself?"
"Apologies, i don't know if this is the wrong sub to post in but, I don't know where else I could. As the title says, recently I've been struggling with the possibility that I may have Aspergers and was wanting to know how I would go about getting some answers. I was always considered the weird kid back in school and college, quite antisocial with only 2-3 friends, finding it impossible to even talk to anyone else. I've never really understood emotions all that well, I can't really grasp when people are happy or sad unless they spell it out for me, and I have trouble describing my own emotions and feelings, often I don't even know how or what I feel. Whenever someone is overly happy, I can't help but analyse it, thinking what's the need to be that loud and in my face about it, when in reality there's nothing wrong with what the person is doing. Eye contact is especially difficult for me, I can't describe how it makes me feel just...uneasy and difficult. It's honestly infuriating that I find it so hard to look my girlfriend of 6 years in the eye, realistically it's not a hard thing to do but for me it's impossible. Noise is also a big issue for me, loud unexpected ones terrify me to the point of tears sometimes which sounds pathetic because it's just a noise but, I can't help it. At certain points in my life, I've just thought chalked it up to me being grumpy or just being a bad person.  How would I go about seeking answers or a diagnosis for this? UK based if that helps."
"When driving around with a friend who may be having a noticeably terrible day, giving them control of the music allows them to express their state of mind without having to work up the courage to tell you. If you hear a song the strongly expresses suicide then it gets it across that they may not be safe alone. An added bonus is that it helps them feel like you appreciate them and their music choice! Listen to your friends and stay safe!"
"A little backstory first; Ok so I just had a miserable break with my girlfriend (LDR atm) almost a week ago. And I was planning my proposal and everything. I fucking love her. I believe shes *the* one. So I do truly love her and I could never muster my self up to hurting her. With words or physically. I'm super careful with my words. Or at least I like to think I am. So like I could not sleep without her. I had(had at the time, not anymore). And one night I went to bed early while she was playing games. I had woken up from a nightmare and was pretty distraught. But she didnt wanna help me. She wanted to help her friend with her friends issue. So I got upset, and went back to bed. Now here is where things get fuzzy. Reading back in our messages now I noticed I said awful and very aggressive and cruel things. Things I would never say. Even if we were bantering. And I have partial glimpse of her messages and stuff in my memory. but none of mine. none. I remember a picture she had sent me. That is the most vivid that I can remember getting. But throughout the argument I dont remember jack shit that I said. It was like I was not myself. Things were still relevant to my feelings for certain things. So they were not just random nonsense. I feel super guilty and basically like a hopeless dumbass because now im struggling to get her back. Another thing is, some of the messages that were sent from either of us, are like completely out of sync with my memory. Like I remember these messages from the morning. Like 8 or 9 am or something. But the time stamps on the messages are like 4 or 5pm. Can anyone give me some insight as to what could be happening? I cant let this happen again, as I'm sure it has happened before, but went unnoticed.   TLDR: dont remember messages and the ones i do are out of sync with my memory and time. Can anyone help?"
"When you open up to somebody-partner, friend, etc.-and they appear supportive initially but then use those exposed vulnerabilities against you in a disagreement or fight later...what do we call this, if even definable?"
"first of all i am usually the rock of my very small group of friends. and for as long as i know ive always been the one to talk to about your problems and everything else. but for some reason today i broke and i dont know what is going on. but long story short i just feel alone just totally alone tryed to suround myself with friends and even then it just felt like i was alone in a room with strangers. keep thining my god your life hasent amounted to shit and your a total failure and to be honest it scares the hell out of me that i would have those thoughts. the think your going to be alone forever and that you will never be good enough for anyone. that your letting your friends and family down, and to have all those thoughts cross your mind for no reason. its scaring me. do i need help or is this something that will pass. please forgive the spelling errors and grammor probably made the worst descision and started drinking."
"I have an 8 year old daughter. Her father suffers from manic depression and bouts of paranoia and delusion. His delusions often lead to dangerous or violent behavior and result in him being incarcerated. He has been out of control and unable to see her for over a year now. Despite how long it's been she struggles regularly with his absence. I've been careful throughout her life not to expose her to his issues, so she has never seen him in anything but a positive light. Now that she is older she has noticed his absence and overheard things from other family members that have forced me to tell her the truth. I was also forced to file a restraining order and put her school on alert when he threatened to abduct her. Because of this I also had to have a conversation with her about her safety and not leaving with him if he approaches her.   Unfortunately her grandmother also told her that her dad is fine and that I was making up stories. Any time she has questioned her grandmother her grandmother has insisted that there is nothing wrong, told her she may be able to or should be able to see him, and otherwise undermined my efforts to help my daughter understand that he is unwell and unsafe.   Now she is utterly confused and gets upset on a weekly basis for one reason or another. She keeps asking to write to him, though I have no idea where he is, how he is living, and have had numerous reports that he is manic and acting out in public. She also apparently brings him up in school regularly and writes about him for class assignments. She expressed an interest in writing about drug use with him as an example for a class speech in the near future, because her grandmother told her he had problems with drugs, which is true but not something I have ever or have ever wanted to discuss with her.   I'm at a loss here. I don't know if I should be honest with her and explain exactly what I mean when I say he is unwell. I don't know if I should be honest that he may very well be going to prison soon as a result of his last violent outburst (multiple felony charges including battery and false imprisonment). I don't know how to tell her that I am deliberately keeping her from her grandmother because the things she tells her are damaging and inappropriate. I don't know how to make her understand that standing up in front of her class and telling them her father has a drug problem is not a good idea, and that it's really not the issue, his mental health is. She's already in therapy to deal with this issue but it seems to be getting worse, not better."
"There's been numerous cases in the past where something will go wrong or I will have a misunderstanding with someone, and instead of directing anger at the other person or if I am upset with them, eventually all of that blame turns inwards, and everything was my fault.  Because almost everything is my fault, I could have acted better, predicted better, done one small thing better, but instead it is all my fault that things went wrong.  I wasn't strong enough, I'm not rational enough, I'm not mature enough, smart enough, successful enough, I'm just the fuck up.  Everyone else would have handled it better, everything must be my fault.  The decisions I made, inevitably made whatever happened my fault. Even if I couldn't predict them or if it was someone else's fault its mine for not reacting in a way that would have made them not faulting.  I can't control others or what they do, so if anything goes wrong it's my fault for not changing and adapting.  I've had this line of logic for a better part of a decade now. I don't understand what it is or how to dull it down.  Because all it does is lead to me back into self hate."
"I'm going to post something here that I posted yesterday in r/Anxiety   I don't know what happened to me nor why I felt this way, and I thought I was over it today but I feel the same, I went outside and felt embarrassed of myself.   Sorry for the long post.  Today I had a little fight with my mother. Today I felt like shit. Today I thought like I used to think a year ago. Today I went back to my insecure, January 2016 self who didn't feel worth it. Today I felt worthless.  I took a pill to help me sleep because I don't want to remember what I felt and thought. I felt to insecure because today my mother criticized everything I said and did. Everything was wrong.  I felt insecure, worthless, not good enough. I then saw myself in the mirror and saw what I saw last year, a huge beast who can't stop eating (even though I'm on my normal weight, and I KNOW that).  Last year I tried starving myself (and obviosuly failed because I'm such a shit-head) just to feel pretty, to feel like a person. I did lose weight, I haven't gained it back but for some reason my brain reactivated that horrifying side that kept saying everybody is looking at you, you're fat, hide yourself, go back to the gym you lazy shit, stop eating, don't be such a fucking whale.  Even though this is very related to women (and I don't know why it is), it affects everybody. I'm a 19 year old guy who feels worthless but still keeps living and smiling because I remind myself everyday of how lucky I've been.  I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts, all I want to do is go to the gym and lose more and more weight, all I see is fat even though people tell me I'm skinny. What has my self worth become and WHY did this fight with my mother make me feel this way!!!  (I'm 179 cm and I weight 68 kg, I know I'm thin but I'm getting these horrible thoughts and right now I'm exhausted like I've never been and all I want to do is stay in bed forever)."
"Hey everyone !  I just finished college. Those 3 past years were marked by apathy, living alone, missing classes and doing nothing else than playing video games, jerking off to porn and eating ice cream every day. I could beat depression and major illness on my own, and to still get my engineering degree. But it left me broken.  Fast forward 5 months (now), and Iâ€™ve healed physically, but I face major challenges. I have to get a job and get a job fast (engineering, Food Science) butâ€¦I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ve sent 20 resumes in 5 months. I just donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t know what I want to do. I donâ€™t know what I want to be. I spend my days on the computer, numbing myself from reality. I have no drive anymore and I have kind of accepted that Iâ€™m going to become homeless. During those three years in college I convinced myself I was a huge loser and developed a very negative self talk which convinced me Iâ€™m going to be homeless and die soon. So I spend my time thinking about it and preparing mentally, instead of working to get a job.  Overall, all I can say is I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care about finding a job. I donâ€™t even care enough to do things that I would enjoy. I have no friends, Iâ€™ve been living alone for years now. It has been 3 years last week that I had sex and nobody had hold me or hugged me or told they liked me in those 3 years.  I have lost the intrinsic desire to move forward and to achieve things. I was once driven and motivated but I donâ€™t see a point in anything now, and I have no clear vision of my future except homelessness and death (I tried to commit suicide in January 2015). I donâ€™t even care about my hygiene or eating right or cleaning my room. I donâ€™t do sports.  To put it in a nutshell: I know I should get a job but I donâ€™t care about anything, and I donâ€™t do anything with my time. Because I have no goal. Iâ€™m not driven. I have no reason to do anything. I know I donâ€™t have much time left until my enumployment time gets too big to find a job but I donâ€™t care. I go through life like a ghost, doing whatever presents itself to me. I lose myself in the internet and in my head. I do what people tell me to do but I don't do anything after deciding for it myself."
"So here's the lowdown, I am on here because I have no family and no one to talk to in real life I have no friends and only one sister who has her own issues. I am having serious trouble with my wife, she said that I am a mean person and call her name's and all that which I will own up to it, I do. Now, however, she went online to talk to people and meet friends that now she has strong feelings for after only a week or two. She said he treats her the way that she wants to be treated and that he is a great guy. I caught a glimpse of what they were talking about and it got sexual and he sent her a pic of himself before he got into the shower. Really I am beyond stressed out, I am so heartbroken anxious and nervous to lose her, I dont want to lose her. She said if I act right I can get another shot with her. I have had so much heartbreak in my life from my mom dying at 14 to my dad leaving the house as I turned 16 and then I lived all alone in my house at 16 and at 19.5 yrs old I went to go to live with my aunt and uncle which they kicked me out because they accused me of drunk driving which I didn't, so at that point I still had two weeks until my ship date for marine corps boot camp so i was forced to sleep on park benches until I got into boot camp and finally succeeded in becoming a Marine. During the marine corps I did well got married and then the worst thing possible happened I got injured and gained weight like crazy because I couldn't run pt. So, because of this issue I was forced to get out after my 4 yrs after being ridiculed and single snout for being a piece of shit. And finally low and behold my shitty job where I make 32,000 a yr on an income supporting me and my wife where I get shit on daily, made fun of, harassed and really just downright embarrassed. I don't know how much more I can honestly take of this my life is really becoming unmanageable and I have already had a time where I was rushed to the emergency room for a severe panic attack and suicidal ideation. I guess I'm just reaching out for a friendly person or people I can talk to."
"I am in the legal profession so the use of and change to neutral uses of language has me really seeing terms in this area contextually feeding into stigma. I also have bipolar disorder so I know that describing something as bipolar can contextually imply something totally different than the definition (i.e. bipolar ganglion) and can see the context of which it CAN be somewhat applicable socially. And due to my situation    One example is persuasive and manipulative. I find that I unknowingly get some rather defensive or confused responses to words I don't even specify intentions with. I had to go through the gauntlet with this one person I know who, ironically manipulative in an unhealthy sense of the term. But this occurs and I try to give examples and in the end say, see that was another example. So I think maybe change that needs to happen needs to be on a different level.    I know narcissism in basic context is self-directed and has been described as healthy or unhealthy in context but is present in all of us. I carelessly used it to described a couple traits we all have in some contexts that are very self directed and part of us wants to tell the other, yeah we know. And my friend's sister and best friend went into warp speed smear campaign etc. There's nothing worse a narcissist but when smile and admit it, it's the worst. I clarified it with most of them.     I had to avoid a of those all of my ex boyfriends are sociopaths and narcissists types who were aggressively interested too. Even though one didn't like a manic tirade of mine when said, birds of a feather flock together. So join reality and accept it and get a therapist and ranted and raved about people using that word like it's the modern Salem Witch Trials while sadistically sucking us into their misery. And she ended up in therapy but I didn't how to handle it when that was the appeal. (NOTE: I felt horrible later and that was on my part very inappropriate. But sometimes these little things can be blessings in disguise)    And Narcissistic Personality Disorder doesn't even have to have behavioral narcissism associated with the obvious narcissism. Martyrdom is very narcissistic and grandiose in the idea the extreme selflessness makes them better, stronger, society would fail without them. I know a few and a lot of people feed into their denial but they are in much of the same way as insufferable as the more I'm the best types because they will often take the spotlight have that attitude.   But most people would probably feel bad about the gut feeling you get eventually until the I personally just need to be with more selfless, giving, charitable people. However, mention the idea of a world without the causes they take on, that callousness comes out. Like Mother Theresa with the The Lords wants these people to be poor etc view. I mean it's callous. But she's not pops into your head.   So, sorry but these are things I see associated with this. And the semantics can feed denial because my younger years were not the greatest. But after rotten manic episodes, I immediately went into I refuse to apologize for a mental illness!! HOW DARE YOU??!! But that was short lived too as by the 3rd time, I realized I had to take some responsibility because it didn't feel completely okay unintentionally or intentionally harmful to others and not express more than well, I'm on meds. So it's to help a lot of us here too overall be be healthier. Getting well overall sort of an overall thing"
"I am a very spontaneous and social person, not someone you would think has anxiety. I love people, have no trouble voicing my opinions or bonding with strangers. I do not consider having anxiety, since what I'm about to describe is more or less the only situation that gives me anxiety. That's why I am so lost about it.  Several times a day, I have flashbacks of things that I did/said that were maybe too spontaneous, or a bit outside the social norms. Like I said, I am very energetic, spontaneous, and maybe a bit weird, so I tend to say and do a lot of things on a daily basis haha. It's rarely anything major ; My problem is not really that I behave in a way that's inappropriate. My problem is that I obsess over it afterwards. When I think about those awkward things, I get physical reactions: shouting something, starting to scratch frenetically, having spasms in my arms/legs.  I start mumbling, speaking to myself, having negative thoughts about myself, fearing how people reacted, what they think of me, etc.. It can be things that happened the same day, or years ago.  Is anyone suffering from the same thing? What do you think it is and what would you do? I do not want to feel like I have to restrain myself...I don't want to become a transparent version of myself to avoid the flashbacks. I'd like to break free from them.   Thank you very much for reading :)"
"This hurts to write, but I have nowhere else to turn to at this time. I cannot tell my family, because of the stigma, and I have to hold it together because she needs me. Her family needs me too so I have to stay strong to not spread further panic.  Yesterday, my SO of many years had a breakdown. I don't know what happened, but after dinner and TV, my SO wasn't making sense. Suddenly she was very scared, and that the world was going to end. I had to call the police for help, because I'm in new town trying to find work as a software engineer and don't know anyone. She is now admitted to the urgent mental health care, and being transferred to a hospital that can take her, because we don't have insurance. I'm not sure she is getting the care she needs. She didn't have any prior history of this, but she has been abused a long time ago that she seemed to have dealt with well.  She also has had a lot of stress due to medical school and if she was being accepted into residency. She has also a strong sense of wanting to help and even in her state of mania all she ask about is how can we make this world a better place, and what is stronger, love or hate. She calls me every few hours when she gets scared and asks these questions.  It hurts so much, and I don't know what to do. I really don't know what I am asking for either, but I do know that I need some help with my situation. I'm scared, because I don't want to loose her and I don't know what I can do for her either.  Update 2017/1/30: Hi everyone, and thank you for responding. I wasn't doing well yesterday, and it was overwhelming first time experiencing this with no warnings (visible to me). So it was extremely sudden, and to see her so frantic and confused is really hard. The feeling is that she isn't getting better, and that she isn't getting the care she needs is overwhelming. I did reach out, but they were closed.   She is now transferred from urgent care to another place I feel is better. I'm hopefully she will get better, and I feel this is now manageable. I want to thank everyone for responding, and even though I didn't respond yesterday (as I was very sad), I did read it and it did make me feel better. So thank you to all of you!  Update 2 on 1/30/2017: I just visited her, and she is doing great. She is now aware, alert and even diagnosed her own condition. She is no longer confused, but will stay at the hospital for a little bit longer. We think it was severe lack of sleep inducing psychosis. Obviously we aren't sure yet, but either way we will manage. Now I just have to deal with cost fallout whenever that hits me."
"I don't know what's been going on with me lately as everyday it seems like I find a new way to screw up and ruin everything for everyone.   Just for background, I am a fourth year media student who lives at home still, 23 years of age. I don't have a job or pay rent at home and my transport and college is covered by a grant.   At home I have my mother and two siblings, and I usually babysit to make my mothers life easy, however lately that has become hard. I can't seem to keep my three year old sibling under control or stop temper tantrums so my mother has to constantly step in, making it difficult for her to relax or clean the house (its hard enough when I'm gone from 7 and back by 9 due to college hours and long distance with public transport. In addition to this, I am horrible with procrastination, I leave assignments to the last minute and never use my time wisely (I.e using free time for leisure instead of college work), and I scapegoat my siblings in my head, blaming them when its my fault, which results in me having some kind of angst when I should be more mature, which makes me feel awful when combined with my recent incompetence.   At this point I don't know what to do to stop being stupid anymore. The best thing would be to use free time for doing work so the stress doesn't make me act like an idiot, which is doable and is a step that I should take rather than dwelling in self pity, but I still seem to ignore that idea and still cause problems for others and it makes me want to die because even though it would hurt people more, my selfish desires are more important I guess.   But I want to stop this so I thought I'd make a post to ask how to deal with rampant procrastination and angst or how do I better followy own advice. If this is not appropriate here, then maybe down vote and ignore or the mods can remove it. Sorry if this doesn't fit here."
"A friend of mine has been having a lot of trouble recently, and I don't know what I can do to help. My friend is a 16yo female who has started cutting, as well as binging and purging, and having at least 3-4 drinks a day, sometimes more (which is a lot for someone who weighs 90 pounds). She's staying like a thousand miles away with relatives, so I the only things I know are whatever her and her friends tell me. Until recently, she hadn't said anything to me, but a mutual friend filled me in on some of what was going on, and she eventually told me herself after she'd hinted at it and I'd asked if she was OK. Before she went off to stay with extended family (a little less than a month ago), her home life with her mother had been really bad - one one occaision she'd taken a large amount of OTC meds to the point where we were worried she'd OD, and then she got very drunk and self-harmed really badly only a few days later, once again leaving friends and family worried she was going to seriously injure or kill herself. Although the stress from dealing with her mother, who's bipolar, isn't present where she is now, she's self-medicating and self-harming even more than before. She isn't persistently depressed however, which is the confusing part - she says she's happy most of the day, but becomes a suicidal trainwreck from the hours of 10pm-1am in her own words. She comes back in about 2 weeks, and when she does she won't have access to alcohol as much, have any access to counseling in the small town she lives in, or have any close friends or family members she gets along with in the area. Normally I'd tell her family or other adults around her or get her to go to a therapist, but it always backfires when her mother finds things out - she gets punished rather than helped - and she has no access to a therapist or any other adults who can help her. I've experienced mental health problems myself, and I'm studying psychology in undergrad at the moment, so I can offer a little bit of advice and support, but I live 3 hours away and she needs someone who's objective, dependable, and qualified to help her. Luckily, she prefers smoking weed over drinking, and will have more access to weed when she gets back, but any kind of self-medicating can be harmful. Alcoholism runs in her family, so it's critical that she stops drinking (or at least starts drinking less) ASAP. I have no idea what to do, and I'd appreciate any advice."
"A little bit about me, I'm a 28M. Married with kids. I've noticed now for quite awhile that I've had severe mood swings and tend to get short with my family, especially my wife. I blame all my problems on others or circumstances. I tend to get irritated easily, get depressed or just get quiet and want to be withdrawn in a sense. This isn't typical to who I am. I'm usually a fun, humorous and outgoing guy. Maybe it's nothing, but I really want advice or an explanation on what's going on. Thanks in advance"
I took Luvox 50mg for two days and it made me a thousand times more anxious then I was before. I've stopped for 2 days but am still feeling the increased anxiety. how long will it be til it's completely out of my system??
"i know a lot of people with mental illness struggle to take care of themselves for multiple reasons so can we maybe compile a list that can help people keep up their hygiene, home, social life, etc. in a managable way?   dry shampoo was a life saver for me. its pretty cheap and if you dont have the energy or motivation to shower it keeps your hair from looking too greasy.  15 minute cleans also helped me. basically you set up a timer for 15 minutes everyday and in those 15 minutes you clean and then you're done. it keeps your house from becoming overwhelmingly dirty but also isnt as daunting as spending a whole day cleaning or cleaning until everything is done.  doea anyone else have any tips?"
"I'm scheduled to see a professional therapist Wednesday, but in preparing for my visit I've been marking down moments where I feel specific things I think are of importance.   background about me: -twenty-one-year-old white/half Hispanic male -live in the suburbs  -suffered a hit to the head when I was four years old in a car accident. Wasn't wearing a seatbelt and flew and hit my head on the dash. -my mother was pregnant with me for ten months. I was induced a month after my expected date. -I was sexually abused by a male teenager a little older than me when I was twelve years old.  -have a poor relationship with my father. My father isn't an emotional person, but I am an emotional person so we tend to not really interact with each other because it leads to constant quarreling. -I was in public school until junior year, finished doing homeschool. -my mother is an immigrant and I did not learn Spanish so I always felt we weren't as close as my older siblings who do talk to her in her native language. -lived in a middle class neighborhood. Father lost his job in 2007 and my mother is in the real estate business. As a result we suffer economically and at one point were about to lose the house.  -my parents have been constantly fighting in front of me since I was born. My mother has left the house many times before when I was in elementary school.   So that's a bit of background about me. Probably too much.   Here are things I think my therapist should know.  -I suffer from depressive moods that leave me fatigued, unmotivated, sluggish, tired, and in bed for majority of the day. These started when I was about twelve, thirteen. This has started to become worse most noticeably in the last couple years  -mood fluctuates throughout the day. Happy in the morning, sad at night. Vice versa. -I suffer from poor sleep. I have a ton of energy at night and usually go to bed at 2am and wake up at 6am, sometimes I get to sleep til 9am -I have recently in the last years slowly withdrawn myself socially from everyone to the point where for the last two years I have spend 99 percent of those days in my room listening to music, browsing the web, and reading.  -I binge eat occasionally. It's not that I'm hungry it's like my mind desires different flavors and wants a taste of that and a taste of that. I'm not obese, I'm a little overweight. -I am in constant seeking of novelty. -I feel anxiety in public places (church, the mall, when I have to go to the store) -I have poor concentration -I lie a lot - I find myself manipulating others to get a desired outcome, usually when I want to avoid being with other people. -I have a strong desire to be closely intimate platonically with a male companion and to have friends and be social. I'm an extrovert (ENFP)  -I don't have desires for sexual intimacy  -I have poor concentration  -I feel like I have no stable personality, my personality adapts to the person I'm with and whatever compliments their persona. -I tend to be overly emotional. I cry when I see roadkill, I cry when I see starving animals, I cry for no reason sometimes. But sometimes the smallest unfortunate event causes me to be overwhelmed and I sob for the rest of the day -feelings of euphoria. This is a new one for me. A few days ago I had a feeling like someone suddenly lit a fire under me and I felt like the guy from limitless. I went on job interviews and nailed them. I felt confident. I went to a public gym for the first time in YEARS. This lasted for about two days and then suddenly I felt myself slipping like a wet sticker sliding down a wall. And I had a depressive episode that began two days ago. -feelings that I'm not in control of my body. I'll be somewhere doing something with someone I never met and then I'll feel absolutely disgusted with myself and not understand why I am here in the first place and it's like waking up after an unplanned nap in the middle of the day and you look around and suddenly realize where you are. -sometimes I feel like there's so much more meaning behind why certain things happen, like why someone did something, why it snowed at this time, why this didn't workout, like there's a force behind the scenes that speaks to me. But I feel like I'm loosing my mind with that one lol. -I empathize with people a lot and see the feelings they tend not to show but I can detect are there. The subtle gestures and visual cues they do lead me to be uncannily correct when it comes to how someone is feeling. -when I was younger I would google if there were such things as empaths or people who had a superpower to feel people's emotions because I honestly felt like I could. -I hear voices sometimes. Or I think I'll hear someone calling my name. But no one is -I have a tendency to be a perfectionist  -And then I am horribly disorganized with personal items and my room can be in constant disarray -and then there's this thing. When I listen to music I suddenly get excited. I do this thing where I beat my hands against my mouth rhythmically. If I am in public listening to music I use my right hand to tap my knee rhythmically. I have been doing this since my car accident. I'll stare at an image and do this as well. Imaging scenarios with a picture whether it be a person a place.  -I suffer from paranoia and always wonder what people's true intentions are -I have a tenancy to think black and white or a better term is splitting where a person is either my idol or they become someone who I no longer want to be around -I have feeling of suicide. Not that I would kill myself but that I desire not to live anymore.   And that's pretty much it. If anyone actually read this I applaud you. Any insight or speculation would be appreciated. I am going to a professional therapist on Wednesday."
"Not sure if this is the right place for this but:  Im a 17 year old living in Nebraska. My entire family situation has consistently gone down hill in the past couple of years and I am finally at my breaking point. In my childhood, my parents constantly argued all the time and even to the point where the police were called to our house on two occasions, both of which forced my dad to leave and stay somewhere else for the night. My dad always slightly mistreated me (he would often get out of hand when he was trying to do mere spankings) but I was never really physically abused. That all went on before about the age of 11-13 where as I was old enough to not take it anymore. Ive always kinda resented my dad and hid behind my mom; that is until I got into high school. I am a junior now, and although I dont get the best grades I am definitely not failing. I work a job as an Apple Rep at Best Buy and make about $11.50 an hour, a job in which I thoroughly enjoy and am passionate about. I work about 20 hours a week, but would like to work more but my mother will not let me. For about the last two years, my mom and I's relationship has gone downhill and I have finally reached my breaking point. Initially, it started out as simply being overbearing about where I am, who Im with etc. (which I can respect, shes a mom) but for about the past six months it has pretty much turned into psychological abuse. She absolutely hates my job and she thinks it is, and I quote, the worst thing thats ever happened to me and that it has ruined my personality. She runs my life like a dictator, whereas if she tells me to do something, if I dont do it the minute she says so, she will raise hell. Its constant arguing with her day in day out, before I go to school, when I get home from school, before I go to bed, constantly. She starts arguments with me over the stupidest, most menial things like: the amount of hours Im working,turning a check into the school, eating breakfast in the morning, stopping at the gas station to get a snack before going to work. Just stupid stuff that doesnt need to be argued about. Like just before I typed this post, she came into my room yelling and screaming because I needed to get off my computer even though I was doing an online personal finance class I need to get done in order to graduate, and also that I was being too loud even though I was just facetiming one of my really good friends. There are many many things beyond that, but she is truly taking a mental toll on me. Really, the only thing I have going against me right now is that she found a pack of rolling papers in my back pack which was left over from experimenting with weed only a handful of times. This was all a week ago and hasnt contributed to the overall problem, really. I have sought out advice from many people, and many people agree that what she puts me through is not acceptable. She has caused me terrible anxiety and depression and I know that if I ever called CPS she would be furious. If I did call CPS and take her to court what would the chances of me being emancipated be? I work a good job, and if I wanted to I could support myself. I am 100% completely and my end right now and I wouldnt be pursuing this decision if I didnt think this was the extreme I had to go to. Any other advice is always appreciated too."
"Hi, So, over the last few years, in addition to generic depression, suicide plans, paranoia &amp; co. (which are largely treated with an NDRI and SSRI) it's been like I spend a lot of time ding precisely nothing but trying to work out which reality is real - the one where everything is fine and I'm doing really well, or the one where my life is falling apart. I'm also not nearly as physically or mentally capable as I used to be. I know I used to be much better, and there's nothing physically stopping me, but still I can't seem to do basic things in an entire day. But whenever I try to work out which perception of reality is accurate it just sends my head into a loop of circular thinking without result. Some people close to me like my (now) ex-wife say that I'm mentally ill and I know it upsets them because they cry and stuff, but I can't tell if they're just trying to manipulate me, if I'm just manipulating them, if everything is okay, or if I'm actually losing my mind. I've also been doing stupid stuff (like bringing drugs into Colombia because I thought it was an 11 hour flight rather than a 4 hour flight or being way less organised for work than I should be.   I don't know, I guess it's normal and everyone has thoughts like that, but, if I'm worried about it is it because I'm unwell causing me to worry that I'm losing my mind? But if that was true, I wouldn't be aware that anything is wrong. Unless I'm losing my mind but haven't totally lost it and can still recognise that something is wrong, but if that were true things wouldn't be working out for me. But if things were working out for me, I wouldn't have been fired and my marriage wouldn't have ended but I know other people think I'm doing well and they can't all be insane. But then I think, what if I'm actually some kind of sociopath and I actually believe my own mask but I'm really just destined to become a monster but that thought upsets me so it wouldn't make sense because if it was true I wouldn't care. Unless, I'm so pathological that I trick myself into thinking I have feelings but in reality I'm actually just using everyone around me. But my friends are smarter than I am so how would I get away with living a double life with them if I was a generic monster. But then I think that there must be something wrong with me because I do weird things like cutting myself or obsessively pulling out body hair. But everyone does that but I'm worried because I don't want to lose everyone but it's like either I'm evil or insane and either way I'm going to slip away into a cautionary tale."
"I'm 23 years old and I suffer from severe depression and social and general anxiety (diagnosed a couple years ago). I don't have insurance, a license, or job, and I, basically, live out in the middle of the woods with my parents and brothers. No one is helping me. My dad is in denial about me suffering from a mental illness and thinks I just lack self-esteem, my brothers believe that if I simply get a job, I'll feel better, even though I can't even talk to anyone without my brain feeling like it's shaking, and my mother suffers from anxiety and depression, as well, and is a complete mess. I called up a mental health resource center in the Summer, which was so hard for me to do, and the guy pretty much told me that sucks. I'm rotting away in my room, and I feel like no one is ever going to help me."
"A heavy title but I am in need of advice relatively quick.  I'm a 28 year old male living in California and my mom who lives with me is 62, she has no drivers license, no income(soon to change) and addicted to various prescribed painkillers and anti depressants for back injuries.  She was an alcoholic most of my life until about 15 years ago when she was got back injuries on the job and then became addicted to prescription meds. I was essentially neglected, living out in the country and never went to school, only partially home schooled due to her being completely wasted. I've never had a girlfriend or any friends which is now by choice. My whole family as far out as I know is alcoholics, drug addicts, religious fanatics, murderers and abusers.  I don't have anything to do with my family and because of their nature there is no support for my mom. She sort of cleared up the last few years and after I got over a bit of homelessness a year ago I opted to allow her to live with me because my dad wanted her gone. My dad has cancer, which is why I took my mom because despite him being an alcoholic most of my childhood he eventually got over it and I do respect him. I didn't want his last days to be miserable because of my mom.  It took a good 5+ years for me to forget what has now left me emotionless. She's been wasted the last few months but got really bad last week. I can't even look at her and can only think of how long it's going to take this time to forget what she has reminded me of. I really, for a long time now, just wish she was dead. But I don't want it to be a direct result of my actions.  Right now she thinks I'll get over it but I don't think I can. I'm supposed to take her shopping and to a doctor this week which means I have to talk to her. I don't even want to hear her excuses or anything she has to say and need to make a decision by then.  I only see a few options. Although she is about to get social security, it is not enough for her to live somewhere. She can't live on her own anyways because of both how disabled she is and how drugged. She is basically only around because I'm the only one who was willing to tolerate her.  I have no problem if she were to continue living with me and just not talk. To go shopping and to appointments by using Uber which she would soon be able to afford. But if I tell her I want nothing to do with her and that's what the rest of her life will be like then she will likely overdose or go stand in traffic.  I could have her sent to a mental institution, where she has been before when my dad found out about her suicide plans detailing how she was going to kill me as well. As angry as I am I know how bad that is. I believe that is worse than death even with as drugged as they would probably keep her and I would just be waiting for a phone call saying she's dead. Knowing that no one would ever visit her.  Or I can continue pretending to have some relationship with her. I really don't want to be miserable and constantly reminded of her for the next 5-15 years. I've never gotten or wanted anything from my family, but was used by them up to the point of being homeless before I decided to cut all ties. I have been sabotaged for nothing more than the satisfaction at times. I just want to be left alone.  I hope there is an alternative that I don't know about. You may think I'm smart by my writing but I don't know much about the world because I've never really talked to people or been around... I'm not even sure what to call it. That is to say how getting an apartment and signing up for utilities were foreign. I had no idea what steps to take. I feel childish in ways. I think a lot of it was never having gone to school where there is structure and specific roles/rules.  Like I think there might be some government program like assisted living that she may be able to qualify for somehow but there's so many services and different branches I wouldn't know where to begin. Even if there was it's still really a inner turmoil for me. I would still be abandoning her. I know exactly what that feels like for obvious reasons and thinking of doing that to her makes me feel that.  I expect you might suggest trying to forgive her. I already know what the best excuse is she can use - that she isn't perfect. That would also be my reason for not being able to forgive her. That line has been played against me by my family countless times. Anytime I had commented about the actions of family members I would hear that.  I've never tried to say I am but I think my own actions portray that. I've only missed 2 days of work in the last decade of a go nowhere minimum wage job with no vacations even through a year of homelessness. I don't do drugs, drink at best twice a year, never stolen or been in any form of trouble, never been late on any bills or borrowed from anyone. I've only tried to avoid or stay out of the way of everyone.  The only benefit I can think of her staying with me would be I could charge her like $200/mo which would sort of offset what she has cost me so far. I haven't been able to afford a dentist so I've just been getting teeth pulled but now almost all of them are bad. I've had constant ear/eye/head aches from how bad they are for the last 3 years or so but that still doesn't offset how much I hate her to consider that a reason to live with her.  So, with you knowing my history of why I'm tormented of dealing with her and also of the potential outcomes, what should I do?"
I have been on Lexapro (Escitalopram) for about 5 months and I'm doing ok. I still feel the side effects every once in a while. I weigh 9.8 stone but she only weighs 7.6 stone. She just got a perscription from her GP this afternoon. I'm worried that she might experience more side effects than I do because she is smaller than me and (her own words) more sensitive.
"This is a deeply personal thing so I'm gonna be vague on details in the post. I'm being mentally tortured by guilt and an inability to ever get closer on something that happened a few weeks ago with someone. I thought it would start healing with time but it's just getting worse, I've ranted to everyone who will hear me and it doesn't help. If you think you can help me get over this and move forward please message me.   EDIT: Ugh hey everyone, thank you for all the lovely messages offering support. I've actually kinda worked through it in a strange way and don't need to talk it through anymore. Thank you."
"I've been struggling with my mental health my entire life, it used to just be depression and anxiety but then PTSD came in and so did ADD and OCD and panic disorders and so on. I've never had hallucinations before this past few months, and I'm really terrified. I'm very sure they're hallucinations because I've been recording videos on my phone of what I'm seeing/hearing and waiting a couple hours before i watch the video. They're hasn't been a single video that actually had what I was seeing/hearing in it.  Just this morning I was walking my dog at like 5:40 AM and there were these big, deep metal screeching sounds coming from the sky. I started panicking real bad and sat down on the front steps of my house. When I looked over at my neighbors house there was a girl there for a second and I started breathing really hard but then she was gone really really soon. This is just an example of what's been happening. I get home from school before my parents on some days, and on those days I hear whispering and talking in my house. The first time it happened I checked to see if the TV was on but it wasn't and I got really scared so I sat outside until my parents got home.  This is the first time this has been happening. And I'm also a freshman in high school (I'm fourteen), and I don't know who to tell. I'm so scared and paranoid all the time now that I can barely fall asleep at night. Advice?"
"I guess I'm not surprised by it, but I recently had the sudden realization that I've developed trust issues and it's affecting my ability to emotionally connect with people. I'm a person that genuinely believes that people almost never try to be cruel, and are generally looking out for their own interests (as we all should be within reason). But somewhere along the way, I seemed to have lost the 'spark' I used to have when meeting people and connecting with my friends and the last couple weeks have taken that to the extreme. Anybody have experience with this? Yes, I'm going to therapy, next appointment is in ~2 weeks. Advice, general or personalized is appreciated.  Background:  I'll try to keep this short, just wanted to provide some context. 30/M. I have depression, which I'm sure factors into it. It's definitely affecting me right now but I've been doing a great job of keeping myself busy and not dropping too low. Over the last 6 years or so, I've had a long string of instances where close friends of mine have ghosted/semi-ghosted on me seemingly out of nowhere. It's something I'm sensitive to, but until recently it hasn't affected my ability to connect with new people.  The last year in particular was especially hard, with...  * Best friend of ~10 months more or less stopped talking to me. When we started actually talking-talking (back when we WERE close friends) we had a serious conversation about these issues I've had in the past, and she expressed having similar issues and vehemently agreed with me that communication was key and frank uncomfortable conversations were far preferable to ghosting. After she stopped talking to me/responding to me 90% of the time, made 3 very strong attempts to talk to her about what was going on before eventually giving up. Later found out she was overwhelmed and depressed, but she basically ignored me for 4 months. I can forgive her for doing what she needed to do if she needed to be left alone, not being able to even tell me what was going on is another matter.  * New friend I got close to, really hit it off with after a month or so. 4 months later, she moves halfway across the country. Absolutely the right decision for her and I don't begrudge her moving  * New person I started dating for about 3 months started withdrawing, eventually said she couldn't date right now because of some (genuinely life-consuming) external circumstances. Basically said that if in a few months I was still interested she'd still like to see me. Did so a few months later, she recently started dating someone else. Long story short I know for a fact that she didn't break up with me to date the other guy.  * Another new friend, wasn't super close - moved about 3 hours away primarily for financial reasons after being friends for ~6 months"
"As much as there has been work towards making mental health issues less taboo, there are certain situations where it's unacceptable.  I've had to adopt my everything's okay persona on and off for more than a decade. And I'm very good at it. However, every time I have to pull it out of the mind closet, it is a little more worn out and a little harder to pull off.  In my day to day life, there are some situations where I'm just the worker bee. Everybody stays out of my way and I stay out of theirs.  However, I have other situations where I'm the leader of others, and in those cases the mental health problems have to go away. The last thing that we want to happen is the sheep following the shepherd off the bridge (metaphorically).  But that persona of mine is getting tough to sustain for any duration. I had to pull it off on Sunday and it lasted a couple of hours before disintegrating on me. With some time to collect myself, I managed to pull a mostly convincing persona off the rest of the day, but it's not enough.  There will be days soon where that persona has to be bright and shiny.  The plan is to work on the underlying problems, obviously, so that persona is unnecessary. But it's going to take time and I to figure something out in the interim. I'm not sure what to do."
"I'm an extremely introverted, reserved person. I don't necessarily come off that way, as I'm okay with talking with people, have a group of friends I see regularly, etc.; however, I've never really shared anything personal with anyone. I have a lot of deep-seeded issues and insecurities that more or less cripple me when it comes to opening up about them. I have so many aspects of my life; secrets, from so many people, including my family and girlfriend. I feel like I've been depressed for a very long time, but am very skilled at putting up a wall and appearing totally fine. I have regular anxiety and often leave the room when I feel that I'm having a panic attack, so not to be noticed. I am not really sure if what I'm saying even makes sense... I'm just typing as thoughts enter my brain at the moment.   I have thought that I needed counseling for years, but always been afraid to schedule anything due to my intense fear of opening up to anyone. Lately, my reservations have finally caught up to me and are beginning to seriously impact my relationship with my girlfriend, whom I love deeply (I've never loved anyone before her and I'm 28 years old). Because of this, I finally have requested an appointment... I just found a therapist off of yelp because I'm too afraid to ask friends that I know see counselors for recommendations or help.   I don't really know what the point of this post is, but I'm mainly just releasing my thoughts about how I feel about what I'm doing.   I haven't heard back from the counselor I reached out to yet, and if I'm being honest, some part of me hopes I don't. I know I need it, but I'm afraid I wont have the strength to go. I guess time will tell.   Thanks for listening."
"Hey I've been thinking over my mental health issues for a while now and I think I have found a good way to describe it.  Recently I've been struggling with some anxiety and depression, nothing super serious, but there is another problem that is really been getting to me.  The problem that really gets to me is just this bad sense of well being. You know those days where you wake up and the whole day everything feels a bit off? You don't feel amazing and maybe some things feel a bit wrong. You feel sort of uncomfortable I guess. Your consciousness feels weird. Well i have this most days now, and it's really been freaking me out. The only way I know how to describe it is this paragraph i just wrote, or maybe by saying my sense of well being feels very off and bad.   Is this caused by anxiety? Or depression? Or maybe a combination of both (don't know a lot about anxiety as i never struggled with it until the recent months)?  Any advice as to what these problems may be or what I could do about it would be amazing and any insight would mean the world to me! Thank you guys so much &lt;3"
"Since 2 weeks, he has been addicted to K-pop, watches v-logs by them and wont stop talking about them. He also keeps sending me their songs although I already told him I am not interested in it. I think this is a mental issue and I wonder how I could get him to reduce his K-pop input."
"OK, so... I've been on Sertraline (Zoloft) for depression for a year and a half now, in varying doses; my current dose is 150mg and it seems to be quite a good plateau in terms of the actual depression.  However, recently, I've noticed myself doing something weird - I'll get lost in a train of thought, and then say the last part of it out loud. When I say out loud I mean *out loud*, at the top of my speaking voice (not shouted, but boldly stated as if for an audience). The things I end up saying aren't gibberish exactly, but probably sound that way out of context.  So far, it only happens when I'm on my own. My mind wanders off-topic more and more, and then I suddenly realise I've basically announced whatever random thing was on my mind to everyone within earshot, and it's always stiffly and oddly phrased, as though it was the answer to a question (like I'm acting out a hypothetical interview concerning whatever I was just daydreaming about, although I don't actually imagine the interview or the question, I just notice when I've said the answer aloud).  Examples from today: Sponsors do need to be up-front about whether their deals come with these kinds of nationalist strings (re: how racing drivers get jobs), Quite honestly, it's a situation not unlike lions and Christians! (re: competition for unpaid internships); Well, frankly, I don't know if she'd even notice? (re: whether the Prime Minister would care about an obscure initiative to redraft an employment law).  None of those things have very much to do with my job or what I'm working on at the time.  Is this a sertraline thing? I've been on 200mg before now and not had this. It's not like I can't concentrate, but that I find my mind wandering on a tangent. I'm a little concerned that this will happen in a board meeting or something and then I'll loudly proclaim Well, it's not a perfect system and I'm not going to pretend I believe it is, but it's the best we have. (another actual quote there).  Anyone have any vaguely similar experiences?"
"I'm a 23 year old woman. Most of my life people have said I was all kinds of things: aloof, cold, apathetic, quiet, etc. I was a serious baby. At my jobs I frequently have complaints that I don't smile or seem rude. My fiancÃ© said that I seem flat.   I try my best to be friendlier but I eventually get comfortable and the mask slips away. I don't really reciprocate smiling so I have to remind myself to do so. It's honestly extremely exhausting going through every day and still getting complaints.   I'm in college and have clinical competencies. Mostly I try to stay out of the way and a mentor failed me and said I am indifferent. My professor said I seem indifferent but that she only understands me because she's known me for a year. I have had plenty of competencies before and no one has had this complaint.   I don't really know where to go. I try as hard as I can but the mask slips every once in a while or I meet someone who is uncomfortable around quiet people. I want to talk to my therapist about this but beyond what I'm already doing, I don't see how I can completely change who I am."
"Can someone tell me if I made the transition safely? I can't stop worrying!  I was on 37.5 mg a day, so I halved it for one day then took the Mirtazapine the next day.  I'm worried that I've given myself brain damage or something by coming off too quickly and mixing the drugs."
"Sorry for the vague title. I already posted this to another subreddit but was told to redirect it here and I feel like it's more appropriate. TL;DR will be at the bottom.  I feel like I'm going crazy or something because this has been a long back and forth battle I've had since I began my teen years. Background: I'm 19 years old and I am a soon to be college student. I have a very loving family, on the surface. Hardworking parents and two older siblings that try to guide me through life. However, I've had a number of things happen to me over the years and I need outside help to see if these things are wrong or not. Ever since I was a little girl, I know I've had self esteem issues that stemmed from my sister's obvious popularity and good looks and both her and my brother's astounding intelligence. With this came high expectations from my parents that they passively enforced with, Well your brother did this better, Your sister is so outgoing and popular, You got a B this semester but you can do better next semester, etc etc. I was a chubby kid who started puberty early at 11 years old and didn't look the greatest. I was above average intelligence but obviously below my siblings. I had several bad speech impediments, including a bad stutter that caused me not to speak all the time, coupled with my siblings shooting me down whenever I spoke because I was wrong in some way. Most of the time, they were joking but I had no idea that was going on. Only learned sarcasm in my last couple years of high school.  My family isn't the greatest with dealing with emotional problems. Usually we address the issue, find some half assed way to fix it or just ignore it altogether. It frustrates me because I've had to deal with a lot all on my own.  The one thing that still gets me was when I came out with my huge secret when I was 13/14 years old: my brother took advantage of my naivety and taught me about sex. It was mostly sexual battery as the police officer called later on when I broke down to my teacher at school. I was around 10 or 11 when he was teaching me and then I stopped it because all of a sudden it felt wrong and my moral compass started to kick in. Shortly before breaking down to my teacher, I woke up in the middle of the night to my brother touching my chest. It was bad all around.  That second incident, I had reported to my mom because I didn't feel safe in my own home. I wrote her a note and I was crying and she came up and hugged me and said, It's normal, your uncles did that to me growing up, and she didn't acknowledge it after that until I broke down to my teachers. I wanted to tell my parents in confidence but I was an emotional wreck and accidentally told my teachers who had to call the police. My family was a mess after that.  There were a lot of things that happened that I'm sitting here trying not to relive but it was a pretty bad moment in my life. What made it worse was how my family treated me. My parents ignored it and sent me to therapy, my brother went to mandatory therapy and my sister took care of my brother. No one took care of me basically and just last year, my sister told me she took care of my brother because she thought my parents were taking care of me.  It didn't stop there. I stopped trusting my family because it blew up to huge proportions and I was just so alone in my pain. I had recently become interested in psychology at that time and so I thought a therapist would be a good thing to do. Big mistake, she was a piss poor excuse of a therapist.  At that time, I made a lot of online friends because I barely made any actual friends. I did have them but I didn't have anyone to trust. Through this time, I was also struggling with my sexuality (I'm bisexual) and I had actually started a long distance relationship with a girl that I met online. She lived in the same state just in a different city. I loved her a lot and I felt like it would be a good time to come out to my parents but I had no way to go about it. So, I asked my therapist how to come out (not mentioning my girlfriend at the time) and she basically told me to wait it out in case it was a phase. So I stopped going and my parents didn't question why I didn't pester them for more sessions, I wonder if they were trying to cover up everything and try to move on.  For years after that, there was a lot of tension in the household. My brother did everything to make it up to me and I eventually forgave him for what he did. My dad hated my brother. It was a huge family mess. CPS came over to the house a lot and my brother had to leave whenever they came. My sister later on told me that it really hurt that he had to do that for me, like it was my fault that everything came out like this.  That has been the major moment in my life where I just broke. From then on, I was almost a shell of a person, trying to find happiness through friends and lovers. I broke up with my girlfriend cause it wasn't working out and proceeded to date an abusive guy, a guy that later tortured me throughout my high school years and then a wonderful guy that I am still friends with to this day.  All throughout high school, I was a mess. I was keeping my grades up until Junior year of high school. I was depressed and suicidal and I cried almost every single day of my life. There was this one time that my sister threatened to out me to my parents because she found my secret Tumblr where I said mean things about my sister. My high school life was anything but happy.  But I persevered. I made it to today. I failed a lot of classes my senior year of high school and so I took a year off from school. My family put a lot of pressure on me (not just my family but my extended family as well) for me to go back to school. I started becoming stronger and fending for myself and putting my foot down. I got a job and I've doing amazing at it and I'm gonna go back to school at the end of February. I still struggled a lot last year in 2016 to keep my head up high (we moved towns and we were homeless for a month).  If you managed to make it through this rambly mess, thank you. I really appreciate it. My life has been a train wreck and I want to get help. That was one of my goals after I turned 18, to go back to therapy and just get help because I know I still struggled. I learned to trust my family again and they squashed it. I told my brother about my depression and he told me that his girlfriend had it way worse and he asked me if I ever tried to commit but I never did. I was invalidated. My sister was the same story, she told me about her boyfriend and his anxiety and I realized that my sister's boyfriend and I are very similar with our families. I found it super ironic. My question will be in the TL;DR.  --- **tl;dr:** I feel like my family has been ignoring all of my problems and I can't confide or trust in them anymore and has inadvertently led to trust issues with other people. I'm still stuck in this weird cycle of anxiety and depression that I want to get help for. Am I overreacting and my family has a weird way of showing their love or what and what's the best method to help with my mental problems?"

"Well, title is a bit self explanatory. I am 21 years old, female, and I have OCD, anxiety, and paranoia.   I do know for sure that I was diagnosed with OCD when I was only 2 years old. My mom literally had to fight with me to wear socks, underwear, and to not rip off clothing because it was slightly (by slightly I mean millimeters) uneven etc. She struggled but in the end it was worth it because (in my opinion) I have almost no OCD tendencies anymore, and never had to go on medication. I still get frustrated when some of my clothes fit weird but I've learnt to shrug it off.   Anxiety &amp; Paranoia - have not gotten a full diagnosis, but have been to a therapist/psychologist who strongly believes I have both. In the process of making an appointment with a psychiatrist to get a more in depth evaluation.   These I feel never were really around until the last about 4-5 years of my life. I've always found myself constantly obsessing over how people see me, if I mess up a sentence I'll beat myself up all day and get so upset to the point of tears for fear of looking like an idiot in front of people. I'm not sure if it is worth mentioning, but I have incredibly low self-esteem (always have) and a lot of issues with nit-picking my body.   Well, I've pretty much been okay with all of this stuff up until recently. It's been somewhat manageable, but it's starting to seep over and pour itself into other areas of my life and it's really starting to affect my quality of life.   I started dating my boyfriend 2 years ago (February 2nd is our anniversary!!) and honestly he's been the best thing to ever happen to me. He's held me through panic attacks and never left or got upset, he ALWAYS tries to understand, and when he can't, he listens and holds me instead. He is AMAZING. We had a rocky beginning (he wasn't totally over his ex yet, and when we started dating he felt wrong being with me and not having let go of his feelings for her yet) but we have since moved past all of that. We are having a bit of a rough patch now because he is struggling with depression, but we will get through it.   Well, pretty much my issue is... I have intrusive thoughts. I know an aspect of OCD is the intrusive thoughts, but I find it bizarre because my OCD is not your typical OCD... being a clean freak etc. I will be going about my day, then all of the sudden, BOOM, vivid image of my boyfriend cheating on me with his ex in my head. With no rhyme or reason for it to be there. Then I start freaking out. It's okay, you're just paranoid leave it alone I tell myself. Then I think, Oh.... what if your instinct is trying to tell you something. What if he is cheating on you?! That must be why I had that random image in my head etc. Things like that. It's almost every day. I am so paranoid. I always think everyone who is close to me has an ulterior motive. And the closer they are to me, the more suspicious I am (hence my thoughts about my boyfriend being the worst, as he is the closest person to me).   I used to be able to handle it, but now I can't anymore. I never know what is my gut feeling and what isn't. I never know if this is my instinct telling me something, or if it's not. And when I tell myself it's not, I get paranoid and think But what if it IS and I just THINK it isn't etc... it's getting to be an extremely exhausting loop.   Just looking if anyone else has experienced this and what they have done to help themselves. Like I said I am in the midst of setting up a session with a psychiatrist, just maybe looking for some advice in the meantime."
"I have been considering speaking with a therapist for quite a long time now - 8-10 years. I have mild overarching anxiety and a slight history with depression. I am interested in speaking with someone on a somewhat regular basis just to be more mentally healthy.   I finally emailed a few in my area that seem like they might suit my needs. I am curious, though, what is the best way to approach this? Should I take on full 90-minute sessions with a few therapists, or would it be best to do a short 10-minute meeting with each? I just want to shop around, and find someone who makes sense for me, but I also don't necessarily know if I want to make a decision in such a short meeting."
"I eat normally the majority of the week, walk some two miles daily (to stay healthy &amp; for school), and I sleep around 11:00pm and wake at 4/5am. On weekends, I feel incredibly depressed, and since I have no school, I struggle to stay busy. As a result, I end up eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which I then purge some of breakfast and most of lunch. This leaves me with light chest pain, an increased heart beat, a need to constantly take deep breaths, and a sore throat. Additionally, I cannot sleep until around four, and so I spend my weekends as an isolated (by choice)bawling wreck of a person. This is not healthy behavior, I'm cognizant of that. I'm not yet 17, but I feel if this continues even another year, my only comfort will be the dirt. But how long until I that time arrives approximately?"
"Hey y'all,   Do any of you have experience creating/leading a support group? This is mainly going to be a group for women in their late teens-30s for a certain community I'm a part of. Some people in this group expressed interest in having some sort of a space where they can air out their struggles/problems.   I don't have a whole lot of experience in leading something like this, so I was wondering if those of you who do have any tips on how to moderate support group discussions and make it so that as many people benefit from it as possible and aren't being talked over (and so it's not super overwhelming)? I was also wondering if it'd be better for the group to have some sort of structure (so perhaps we explore a certain topic during each discussion) or if it should be slightly guided, or not guided at all.   I was thinking of also doing some sort of a support buddy type thing, where I pair up girls based on common interests/struggles so they can talk to each other one on one. The goal is that they meet up at least once a month.   &lt;3  Self Help Geek"

I know nothing is wrong with me for having some form of mental disorder but I need help figuring out what is up. So I know I have diagnosed depression but I feel there is more to it. So every now and then I just become emotionally disconnected like I don't care about my self or others and then I don't care what other people have to say or there like boundries and I just become a dick sort of and I don't feel bad about it at all for a while or really care what happens to me because of it and then I realise how shitty I have been then care a lot and feel super sad about and I mean super sad like I just wanna die and I just wanna know what's up so I can try and deal with it also I would go to a Dr about these issues but I would have to communicate that to my parents and they like don't believe that kind of shit they don't even think I'm depressed even though a Dr told them I was
"I haven't slept properly for 2 months. Yeah you heard it. I haven't had a good nights sleep since december and I think I'm going crazy.  Basically I try to get in bed at the same time every day but I just cannot fall asleep no matter how tired I am. I fall asleep really late, like 4-5 hours after I've gone to bed and it frustrates the shit out me because then I only sleep 2-3 hours maximum.  I'm working full time so I come to work every day feeling like a zombie and I hate it. My mood has worsened and I'm withdrawing from family and friends and have no energy to do anything. I have anxiety and it has only gotten worse.  I have tried sleeping pills you get over the counter and they do nothing. I was at the doctor and he refused to prescribe me real sleeping pills for some reason.  Please help I'm going fully crazy soon"
"My bf recently broke up with me, because of reasons like I'm overweight etc. I am trying to get over it but I have no one, I go to counselling, I am on antidepressants but nothing is getting better. I go to college and will be hopefully going to uni to study archaeology next year but I can't do it. Everyday I think about him, everytime I think about him being with someone else, I just want to burst out crying and break everything. I really don't know how to deal with this."
"So a year ago I got over my xanax addiction and since then I have been super motivated; exercising putting in the work for my film making dreams. Though last month I hit a wall and started using cocaine and drinking a lot, eventually I got my act together and this was followed by an insane amount of productivity. I find myself now back in this regime using a cocaine multiples times daily, not accomplishing anything and feeling very depressed. I know that I most likely have addiction issues, but was curious whether this may have psychological roots?  thanks in advance"
"Just answer the question, please. Explain."
I checked myself in thinking that I could leave whenever I wanted. Now a few hours later I have a plan to go to an actual mental health facility with my father tomorrow and they still won't let me go.   It almost feels like its out of spite. Like Oh you think you're fucked enough for this huh? Think your thoughts are too crazy? Well now you're locked in for good   I just can't get to a place where I actually think these quacks are trying to help me. For Pete's sake I'm in a converted storage bay and attended to by an ER doctor who himself said he is winging it.   I want out but I don't know how to get it. Help Reddit can they actually legally bind me here?
"the other night i was standing in the doorway of my bedroom and looking into the hall and i was like frozen and it felt like my house had changed. it was like it was a dream. i went downstairs and i went into the bathroom and i looked at my face and it got all blurry and the light was like swirling around with it and i saw someone else's face as part of my face. i looked like a monster. like a human monster though. it felt like i was moving the face in the mirror with my face. bending the light and the mirror. it was really strange. i had my first panic attack in a while the next day. it was while i was driving and everthing was pretty overwhelming so i parked in a random parking lot so i wouldn't like crash and walked the rest of the way to work. idk maybe it wasn't a panic attack i really don't know but essentially i get really nervous about seeing certain people when i go out and i hyperventilate and have trouble moving properly. everything gets blurry. (CW:pedophilia/human trafficking for this part) one time i was like half unconcious from the lack of O2, due to hyoerventilating, i guess and i kept thinking i was 6 and i was being sold to pedophiles online when i was able to move again i decided to take some oxycodone i had leftover from when i got my wisdom teeth out. basically i fell guilty like i am making too much out of normal feelings or faking these occurrences lmao."
"I got diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety with social phobia in November of 2014 after becoming suicidal. The doctors put my on fluoxetine (Prozac) which made me worse to the point where I actually attempted. That led to me being put onto Sertraline (Zoloft). Over the last 18 months, I've had several dosage adjustments leading me to maxing out the dosage for this medication with seemingly no improvement on my mental health. If anything, it appears to have gotten worse.   The cycle goes as follows:   - Gets medication dosage increased - Gradually start to feel better  - (couple of months pass) Slowly start to feel worse  - Suddenly reach a whole new level of depression  - Becomes suicidal  - Repeat   That cycle has been my life since I got diagnosed. The first dosage adjustment was around 10 months after I started taking the medication. The latest has been a month and a half. Over time, I think my tolerance to the sertraline has increased causing it to stop working much more rapidly than before.   What do I do now though? I've maxed out the dosage. Will my doctor prescribe me something additional to take with the medication I'm already on or will I have to start from scratch with a new medication and hope it works? What if nothing will ever work and I'm stuck in this cycle for the rest of my life? I don't think I could take it.   Has anyone ever gone into recovery without seeing a counsellor, therapist or psychiatrist? Is it even possible? I can't see any of those, so I am strictly limited to medication unless I ever get sectioned. My social phobia prevents me from speaking to strangers. It also prevents me from speaking to my family about my problems due to an incessant worry that I'm bothering them. This leaves me to my own thoughts with my only confidant being my extremely caring doctor who has been working with me since I got diagnosed. The occasional online post such as this one helps too.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just want to find a way to end this cycle without having to speak to anyone official, so that I can go out and live the life I wanted."
"So far, my depression is fairly under control, and I would say it is definitely way better then it has been in the past. That being said I still have like these moments of fake 'clarity' that basically make me feel really unsatisfied with some of the people I'm friends with. I feel like I try to stay in touch with people I don't see very often because I consider them good friends and they also consider me a close friend but like they just kind of never reach out, or only do so when it seems like I'm having a great time (Through social media or whatever.) It's kind of frustrating because part of me feels like I am mad at my friends for not trying to talk to me more if they say they want to be like good life long friends, but another part of me realizes that I am being too critical and obviously people get busy with their daily lives because I do too.   That's also how I feel with my depression in general, like one half of myself is like this pessimistic person and the other half is trying to calm me down and be realistic and I just end up exhausted.  I think I maybe feeling this way though because I probably have built up a tolerance to my medication, I plan to see my doctor but I don't even get to see my therapist about these issues very often because lack of time. I just don't know what to even think! I feel like I'm just losing friends, like real friends, not just people I'm friendly to at school like just genuine friendships where we both want to make time to hang out with and talk to each other.  I hope this is just the medication thing otherwise I think I'm turning into a huge fucking loser, I started eating lunch alone because I just feel like I don't have any friends or groups that would want to include me or I would want to be included in.  hopefully this makes sense to someone."
"Since I was about fifteen or sixteen I have had bizzare moments. Like not wanting to be alone yet hating being around people. For several months I suddenly became terrified of a train horn, like literally everytime I heard it I would jump out of my skin and nearly wet myself. I would spend hours alone in my room not doing anything but sitting or laying on my bed trying not to cry for unknown reasons. As years passed the moments became less frequent and I chalked it up to hormones. But now here I am almost twenty one and I have to fight myself to accomplish anything and tonight I spent several hours in my closet crying for no reason. I've never told anyone or been to a psychiatrist because I don't trust them."
"Over the past 6 months or so I have started to notice that I have been becoming very worried about forgetting if I actually did what I was going to do or if I'm just remembering another time.  For example something as small as flushing the toilet, I have to do something strange to make the act of flushing the toilet actually be remembered by me. I'll sometimes say out loud something like the toilet is flushed to make some sort of unique memory so when I think back to whether or not I did was I was supposed to do, I actually have memory of doing it.  This happens with a lot of things, locking doors, turning off lights, turning off stoves, etc. If I dont do something unique or something to stand out I could become obsessed with the thought of whether or not I actually did it and it wont be relieved until I go and check to see if I did it and then do something unique so I remember it this time.  This has become a pretty big annoyance in my life and I dont want it to get any worse. Not sure if its something like OCD or maybe just bad anxiety. If anyone has some insight on my problem or have experienced anything like it before and has input I would greatly appreciate it."
"It is coming up on one year from my non- consensual sexual experience and I don't think I'm as well off as I thought I was. I thought I was ok honestly, for the most part at least. But than on Saturday night in the middle of fairly normal (for us) sex with my boyfriend I suddenly remembered something the man had said to me last February and I remebered it in his voice. I saw his face for a second and jt felt the same. I pushed my boyfriend off asking him to stop (he did right away) and tried to explain why. I said I just remembered something and before I could say anything else I just broke down, right there in his bed. He covered me up and held me and tried to comfort me but I couldn't stop crying. I kept saying things. 'I'm sorry' 'why didn't I report it?' 'Why did he do it?' Ect. I realized I can't even say the R word. I can't even type it here, notice my overcomplicated wording up top. I can't call myself a victim out loud and I obviously haven't worked though this. My boyfriend was great about it. He just held me and told me its going to be ok and not to be sorry. When I finally calmed down enough to talk to him I asked him to hand me my clothing and not look while I got dressed and to get dressed himself. He did this without question but I can't figure out why after haveing slept with this man so many times in the past it is suddenly bugging me now. He didn't so much as touch me until I told him it was ok too and that took me until the next night (we are normally a very active couple).  It took about 8 or 9 months after the incident for me to have sex again in the first place. Now I'm always worried this will happen again. I don't want to relive this. What is happening to me? I want to enjoy my boyfriends company again. Please help!"
"My most recent run of bad luck in losing my job, and this break down in the aftermath, has me questioning whether I can really take care of myself properly. And if I can't, what am I supposed to do?    The first few nights afterward I had terrible nightmares and after that I haven't been able to get to sleep until I'm absolutely exhausted and don't have a choice. Usually somewhere around 5 in the morning now. I sleep late because of that and find myself panicking over the thought of job hunting right now. I am an absolute mess. Just getting my work done for classes is taking every bit of energy out of me that isn't spent worrying about my financial state.    I am 26 and have been on mood stabilizers sense the age of 13. I was assaulted at that age and after apparently never dealing with it and other incidents properly, PTSD warped into my current state of what I am told is probably Borderline Personality Disorder. But sense they arrived at that last conclusion after years of medicating me for so many other disorders, I've always taken the judgment with a grain of salt.    The last time I was hospitalized was almost exactly 2 years ago. For a stent of a week. I've always hated the time I spend in the hospital because I know I don't have the money to be missing work or paying the bill. Now it seems I've just developed an outright phobia because the hospital setting has been in my nightmares too.    I moved from my parents house in August to a town four hours away to finish up my degree. I wanted so badly to be able to be on my own and I feel like my world is falling down around me because of it. I had had to move back in with my parents after my best friend and I had a rather large fright and she announced that I was absolutely impossible to live with or even be around any more. That was devastating in itself so I'm sure I wanted to leave town because of that too.    Now I'm in a place where I'm completely frightened that I might have tried to do too much. But I can't expect anyone to take care of me. My family doesn't have the means. I felt like I had to at least try to do something for myself.    I need to formulate some sort of plan to make it to May here where I am, until I can move back home and figure the rest out. But I have no energy and my fear of absolutely everything makes me break down in stupid little fits a couple times a day. I'm not always this way, all whining and scared. But any time I feel like I'm not safe in some way, I tend to be so irrational. I have enough savings to get me through next month. I should be calmly looking for a job right now.    I need advice on any little things I can do to make myself feel better enough to get out and do the things I need to do to keep my life together right now."
"Hi  I have been **suffering from OCD for the past 2 years,** I have been on medication for the past 6 to 7 months and during this time my intrusive thoughts have reduced considerably, I still do get thoughts every day but none of them are too violent and I have a great deal of control over them.  But over the **past 2 weeks my thought frequency has increased** to a certain extent (definitely not as high as before) and apart from that, I am having a **bit of trouble sleeping while having a few scary instances in the middle of the night.**  I usually have some dream or vision which **I forget within 2 to 3 seconds** and I don't think the dream lasted for long either, as far as I remember the dream started for a few seconds and I woke up immediately after that, these are some of the instances I remember well,  1) I am half awake and all of a sudden **I see someone sitting on my sofa** which is opposite to my bed, I get scared and realize that **he is actually one of the robbers who had entered my house** that night, 2 seconds later I realize that **he is actually a guest who had come for a family gathering** in my house and feel bad that I am sleeping when there are guests at home, **after 3 to 4 seconds I realize that there is no person on my sofa, just my bag (which looks nothing like a person).**  2) Again I have some dream which **I forget within 1 or 2 seconds** of waking up, I am still half asleep when **I see a large object outside my window,** I realize that **two people are stealing something** from our balcony and start feeling anxious, but just **2 to 3 seconds later** I realize that it is actually a calendar hung in front of my window which is actually inside my room.   3) This time my **aunt came into my room** and asked me to wake up, I realized that it was already **5 AM (my usual wake up time)** so I started getting up, but when I checked why my alarm didn't ring on my phone, I noticed that the **time was 3:37 AM,** the same on my watch as well, after nearly 20 to 30 seconds I realize that my aunt did not enter my room.  **Aftermath**  Usually, after getting such dreams I find it **difficult to get back to sleep for at least 5 to 10 minutes,** I am scared to close my eyes and to sleep on my sides, so I sleep straight and cautiously close my eyes while waking up for even the slightest noise.  This is weird because some of them aren't even scary, I don't remember most of them, so I have no idea why I feel anxious and scared at that point!  **Let me know if anyone has experienced something like this.**"
"i'm about to sound insane but please believe me i'm aware of it. also, i'll pathetically ask for you guys not judge me too hard or mock me.  i have depression and anxiety. it was kept in check for a long while, then in 2012 i started a relationship when i knew i shouldn't have, and my mental health began deteriorating again. through 2012 to 2015 i was in hell, and my partner of course left me. i then fell into this huge breakup depression coupled with the clinical depression i carry with me all the time. end of 2016, i decided to put an end to this struggle, and began to let go of everything that was hurting me. it worked, i felt like myself again, like the me before 2012. except i wasn't.  for some reason, while i am feeling better than i was, my anxiety has increased out of nowhere. i keep finding things to worry about: my pets health, my parents health, if someone i love doesn't answer the phone, i think tragedy right away and get frentic and call until they pick up, if my pets prefer to go to sleep instead of playing with me, i think they're sick or they hate me even though i know they're fine and healthy, but i keep driving myself crazy over it. before them, i lost two pets out of nowhere and it scarred me forever, so i know when i see my current pets that fear just comes back.  my point is: i'm scared of losing the ones i love, and after being left by the man i was in love with, this fear only increased.  that's not so bad, right? it's unhealthy but hey, it's part of the illness. okay.  now here's the part i tell you i'm sick to my stomach today and wanting to cry my eyes out because i found out that my favorite character's fate in a game was left in a twist ending and i won't know what happens until august because of a dlc that will explain the rest of the story. on top of that, they might have changed his model.  i am freaking out. i am scared of the possible outcomes for this character fate as if he's a real person. i am, of course, aware that he's not real, but it's gut wrenching and the wait is even worse.  here's the funny bit: i freaked out about the same thing back in 2012 when he starred in a game that year. 2012 was the year that i began falling apart.  i'm crying because i know this is insane and i swear i don't want to feel like this, but i am and i'm not understanding why. why am i so attatched? why am i feeling like this? i need something, anything. people around me are asking me questions, why am i so upset? and the thing is, i cry about the character and then i cry about everything's that has gone wrong in my life so far.  i tried booking a session but they told me to try next month. i don't know what to do. please, any kind soul who can maybe explain to me why i'm so messed up why a character means this much, anyone who can offer me a way to get over this, i'll take it. i'm going insane."
"Hi,  Sorry if this is the wrong place :/ but for the majority of the month I'm generally very low and negative, don't really care about things anymore etc etc( but yes some days are better than others). But then the week or so after my period finishes I feel great and happy and stuff, completely different to normal. Then I crash again until the end of the next one..  Any ideas what this is?? Is it just a coincidence or me feeling a bit better then carrying that on if that makes sense? Thank you (if it helps I'm 17)"
"So I'm struggling to know what to do - I have finally dealt with my depression in a way that has made it much more manageable (TMS - no medication did anything but make my depression worse) but a problem remains.   My husband keeps telling me I view reality in a way that is skewed that he thinks is what keeps pushing me back into depression because I view things as worse than they are and take things too personally. I see a therapist and do mindfulness practice, but I still see things the way I do, but I am starting to agree with him because I'll get very upset over something like a take conversation that I view as negative, yet when my husband reads it and tells me what he thinks actually is the situation, he always ends up being right. I'm starting to fee crazy because I don't understand how I can misread situations so badly and I don't know how to work on this.  Does anyone know what this would be called, if anything, and ways to improve? It's miserable to constantly feel like people are upset with me when it turns out they aren't, or to think a situation went badly or is unfixable and turn out to have totally misjudged it. My husband is mostly understanding but I can tell he's getting sick of having to explain to me why I should stop crying or stop feeling rejected over things and he's told me sometimes he feels like I'm intentionally lying about situations to be the victim and get his attention. I'm absolutely not doing that and it's hard to hear he feels that way. I wouldn't want to deal with that, either.  I hope this makes sense and someone can at least relate..."
"Hi,  So basically my mum takes at least 10 ,possibly up to 20, laxatives a day but eats fairly normally and drinks loads (non-alcoholic!) so more of an addiction rather than an eating disorder I think??  She also goes through around 2-3 bottles of gin a week.   I've come to accept this as normal but surely it shouldn't be?? Like it doesn't worry me as much anymore, I used to be annoyed at her for it but now I just feel it's kind of sad. It's almost like waiting for something in her body to go wrong. This has continued for at least 5 years.  Is this even a problem?? She won't talk about it whatsoever or even accept it so...? There's not a lot I can do but I know if something ever does happen because of this I'll feel guilty for not trying to do something??? Help?! Like on the outside she seems like a completely unaffected person...  Thank you x"
"It was anxiety and depression exacerbated by her job with a souless company, that drove her to self harm. I didn't catch it at all, until she showed me her arm; cuts from her wrist to her elbow. It''s been cold where we live, so her wearing long sleeve shirts didn't set off any internal alarms.  Just dropped her off this morning, she told me to go to work and an orderly ushered her behind a door for admittance. Can't talk to her, she's not allowed cell phone or inbound calls. Can't visit her except for an hour on Saturday. Can't blame myself for her problems, just for missing them.   Where exactly do I go from here? Has anyone else dealt with a spouse going to inpatient care before, especially with an unknown release date? I have my own counseling set up in a few days."
"Over the past year or so I've been feeling mostly empty emotionally. In scenarios where I should be happy or sad, I don't feel anything. No effect. Also, I have a very self destructive mindset I've had for a long while so I often make myself feel down and sad for days on end. As well as that I find it difficult to have faith in my beliefs and goals, feeling like they don't match my personality. I want to go and see if it's a problem but I don't want my parents to know. Any way of getting an appointment without parents knowing and does any know what these symptoms mean?"
"Having been at both ends of the spectrum in regards to the message that my t.v is directly communicating with me, I find myself wondering, that if on some scale it is surely constantly stating its point of view on my life.   When it is directly commanding action, maybe with religious overtones, you can be a demon trapped in hell. Trapped in Hell with the belief that you have enormous control over the universe. Control that can be executed with a mere thought, but you dare not. For you and the television both know that to act is to lose this game, this struggle, this dance with madness that sees you desperately trying to find a path back to heaven. While your brain intercepts the last shreds of reality and joyfully twists them to suit the psychosis, the narrative can continue unchecked. You learn to think like the T.V. It becomes an extension of your thought, finishing every sentence, echoing every impulse, every emotion. It's not so much that it is telling you what to do, but every image absolutely reinforces your thought process. The heavens thunder with the pulse of your heart, and the beauty of insanity shines out from every pore.   Sometimes it is simply paranoia. Although paranoia is never simple in the minds of the paranoid, and can often include quite an exciting premise. One of my favourites was always the intergalactic television show. This glorious production, in which all matter and consciousness in the universe is watching you for some sort of entertainment, literally an intergalactic television show. The world is your stage, and nothing you can possibly do has any more consequences than anything that you might see on regular television. This makes the action sequences quite a bit more dangerous and troublesome to the police, but overall it's a great time. You don't usually see and converse with complete beings that aren't there during extreme paranoia, but the television serves as a great medium to convey your instructions, on just what it is your supposed to do in this grand play. Lots of talking to trees, directing traffic with a stick, dressing up in various military and martial arts costumes, acting out characters you have read about in the bible, seen on T.V programs...you know the usual behaviours.   Somewhere in the realm of normal exists a basic commentary on your everyday life. I mean, I am an ordinary creature doing ordinary things, and the television is about ordinary creatures doing ordinary things...so it makes perfect logical sense that at certain points those things are going to line up. It is not always a sign of mental instability when something that just occurred to you, occurs on the television at the exact moment you happen to be thinking about it. It is not always an episode, when the episode of your favourite sitcom happens to be detailing exactly the situation that your going through. Or that movies you were not previously aware of seem to mimic in great detail a narrative that your life has been following..... But sometimes it is.   Sometimes your struggling with an even greater injustice. One to that shield of self righteousness the mind has set up to guard your ego from disagreeing entities in your story. Sometimes when the morning staff unlocks the door to your solitary room, the door to the back....the door with the small window through which the other patients peek at you as they shamble past on their wild walks.......Sometimes the television doesn't talk to you. I can't hear a thing......and that fat bastard won't give me the remote because I yelled at him for taking away my cigarettes...........end"
"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I just realized something about myself and didn't know if anyone could explain it without me having to go to my therapist.  So I work in a vet clinic and sometimes get bit and scratched by the animals and I kinda like it. Not like a sexual thing or anything, part of me just likes getting injured and then bleeding and then hopefully scarring.  I have no desire to do these things to myself but I'm always secretly hoping something will happen to me.  Idk if it's just some weird fascination with my own blood or something but I just really like it.   Does anyone have any sort of reasoning or similar situations?"
"I'm a 14-year-old girl, and recently, I've been more aware of my bizarre sexual fantasies. I'm not sure if all teenagers experience them, but please give your opinion. All of them involve only the same-sex, and they're very violent, yet erotic and intense. They include unconscious bodies that I would caress and fondle. In the weirdest ones, I'm even killing the other person and sexually pleasuring myself with their corpses. These vivid thoughts deeply arouse me, and I'm perplexed by their emergence in my life. I understand the huge disparity between reality and fantasy and that some sexual desires are taboo or socially unacceptable, but healthy to have. Still, I'm not sure if MINE, in particular, would be considered average or abnormal. If my fantasies indicate an underlying issue, they're probably due to my insecurity, loneliness, need for control, sexual frustration, or just melancholy. In my ideal dreams, my partner would not be able to react negatively, so I can just project my affection to them without any objections. I don't know how to express my love for people in real life. I perform and excel at my absolute potential at school, which contributes to my lack of any social life and loner image. I'm often ignored or excluded by my peers because they assume I'm unfriendly. In reality, I can't express my feelings properly and am partially timid and shy. However, I'm a benign, yet socially awkward teen. I don't want to hurt anyone nor make people angry at me. Also, my parents and environment have no part in this. I come from a hospitable, loving family and household.Though, sometimes I have to force myself to act normal, especially when I'm actually distressed internally. In those cases, I would cry over loneliness or hopeless longing whilst alone. Needless to say, I prefer to keep to myself and not share my thoughts. Once again, I don't know how these sexually deviant thoughts formed nor why they only include girls, never boys. I've never attempted to harm anyone or anything, though I find it difficult to empathize at times. I'm always fidgeting, smiling, or giggling around other girls, but not guys, except for an occasional smile. I can forget these fantasies for a brief period, but they eventually return even stronger. Once again, I AM A TEENAGE GIRL. NOT A GUY!"
"Hello,  I was put on Depakote (valproate) after a load of other meds failed. I suffer from severe depression, moodswings and anxiety. I started off with 300 mg daily and am now taking 900 mg daily (prolonged release version).  It has been two months now, and I notice no effects yet whatsoever. I still experience moodswings to an extreme degree and my lows are still so bad reaching the point at which I get intrusive suicide thoughts.  Has anyone ever been on Depakote? What was your dosage? What did you notice? When did you first start to notice anything difference? Did you experience any side-effects?  Please note that I am not bipolar, in contrary to the majority of people taking this med. I was given an anticonvulsant as my psychiatrist simply has little options left.  Thanks!"
"After reading about a thousand posts on the mental health, mental illness, self-harm, adult survivors, anxiety, depression, PTSD and BPD subreddits through the conceptual filters of 10 years of post-grad education in neurobiology, psychopharmacology, addictive behaviors, social psychology and about 30 types of psychotherapy; I'm pretty convinced that STRESS is at the bottom of about 90% of the complaints I have seen.   Further (and because I get to see and hear the same sort of thing out here in the physical world), I'm just about convinced that 65 to 75% of those 1,000 complaints would be manageable if the *current* (as opposed to traumatic event or early life) stressors of living in the material world without adequate skills and resources were corrected. In many cases, I agree that remedial work for the terrifying event or early life trauma *is* necessary, but sense very clearly that if the *present* day stress is not greatly reduced, all the therapy in the world will not accomplish much.   Much of the stress in our lives is self-induced as the result of using coping mechanisms that don't jibe well with things the way they are and not the way they are not. One can pick up more effective coping mechanisms from the various skills training therapies like the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking, and Schema Therapy; as well as the super (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).   But trying to use those skills when one continues to be committed to trying to run an *exhausting* daily marathon against the challenges of work, family, exercise, recreational drugs, social drinking, pseudo-spirituality and/or continual social media-tion, forces the autonomic nervous system into relentless, unrelieved [fight, flight or freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=fight+flight+freeze), which is a surefire formula for inducing [complex post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=c-ptsd). Because C-PTSD is what I see all over the place, both here, and in the physical world of mental health (not).   I use a compilation of the cognitive and mindfulness-based, super-cognitive therapies called the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to keep me from slipping back into the (truly *awful*) C-PTSD I had for nine years from '94 to '03, because I have enough experience with all of the others listed above to be able to do so. But I had to start somewhere, and suggest that others who *start somewhere* with those nine therapies will ultimately get to where they will stop buying into all of the crass, self-destructive rat-racing most of us do because of all the caca we bought from the Commercial Culture of the [Consensus Trance](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+for+Recovery+from+the+Consensus+Trance).   Comments, critiques, criticisms, dismissals and harsh invective will all be entertained. :-)"
"Sorry for the quotations, I am not sure how to explain everything.  I have no idea how to describe it, but before that a bit of background I am a 16 year old male.  Roughly a year ago I would go through a sudden feeling of understanding who I am. Not in the sense of knowing my purpose but literally knowing who I am.   A way to describe it is, you know who you are. Your age, weight, height, daily routine and family. You automatically know who you are its just normal innit well for me this would sometimes hit suddenly at any time any place and I would just stare off processing my thoughts. It is as if I was an alien replacing a human but suddenly receiving all the memories and thoughts of that human but I would know (or at least feel) that I wasn't me before this experience. All the people around me, when I look at them I would then suddenly realise new features about them, that they have a slightly rigid nose, long eyelashes etc. But I know inside that I knew they had these before but I didn't know the specifics.  Well at first I would get this maybe twice or thrice a week and they were intense. I would suddenly become emotional and break down and go and hug my sisters, kiss my parents and send appreciation texts to my friends. I have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts so whenever I did this people would sometimes get worried and think I might go and do something stupid but the way I would feel is intensely happy and mind blown like I had uncovered a secret to the universe.  Now this happens really quite frequently maybe someday multiple times a day but the emotions are not as intense usually, sometimes it would feel intense but most of the time its just a feeling of now understand everything. And every single time I would feel like the person before me didn't realise who they were them self and that the new me had just uncovered the truth. It drives me a little crazy but I put up with it but today is when I started getting worried.   I have been feeling ill the past few days and yesterday when I came home at about 4 I went straight to bed and slept until about 6 but I was still feeling ill so I didn't go to school. At around 7:30 my mum woke up and greeted and me and when I looked at her she looked different, something was off her face was slightly less long and more wide which made me feel weird. I then went to the toilet since I was feeling sick and looked in the mirror and when I saw myself I felt really queasy. I saw someone who looked a bit like me, like if you compared what I saw and what I look like you think that we were related or something, the person I saw had a quite a bit longer face and facial features, smaller eyes and ears that went in a bit more. I started to feel dizzy and stared at my new face and was just feeling really weird. I stood outside and just took a bit of time to recover and when I looked back in the mirror my face was normal again and my mum looked the same as before but I didn't feel the same again.   Later I had one of my moments, around 2:00, where I realised who I was bla bla bla but not quite mild and didn't pay attention but this whole experience has been stressing me out.   Some other information is I suffer a bit of anxiety and just don't feel mentally fit in general, especially around Winter. Doc says I likely have S.A.D. I have taken small amounts of weed twice in the past few weeks, first time didn't feel anything and the second time I didn't much. I also have a history of codeine, 450mg once a week but I am stopping since I know I can't keep this up.  I was wondering if anyone knows what the hell is happening, I will be seeing my doctor again sometime this week.  EDIT: After reading the sidebar I can relate so depersonalization/derealization but also the complete opposite."
"This happened not 2 hours ago. Apologies for the terrible formatting beforehand. I'm currently sitting in a behavioral hospital with my parents and they are about as clueless as me. I feel stupid for asking here, but I don't know who else to ask for reputable info. My little brother has had problems with some form of anxiety, maybe OCD, where if he touches certain things he begins to have panic attacks. Today he touched the ground with his bare hands and began screaming hysterically. He then proceeded to open his window on the second floor of our house. For some reason, it didn't register immediately that he was about to go out of it. He leaned backwards, but I managed to pull him back up.   He is claiming that he cannot live at home anymore. Anything anyone touched in the house has been infected and his touching anything without a glove sends him into an attack. My parents were in the process of getting him psychiatric help, but I guess they were too late.   It seems like our only option is a behavioral health facility. I really don't want him to go somewhere where he'll be mistreated. We live in Florida. Who can I talk to, or what facility would work for him?"
"A little background info on me, I'm a twenty-two year old woman, I am a virgin, and I'm bisexual. I suffer from depression, ADHD, OCD, Aspergers, and Schizoaffective disorder.   I grew up relatively sheltered. I knew that sex made babies at the usual age kids figure that stuff out, but never thought of doing it for pleasure. I blame that slightly on elementary school sex Ed. I went to a public school, but sex Ed was oddly Christian in meaning. They taught us nothing about sex, other than sex was bad, masturbation is bad, don't touch yourself, don't fuck before marriage, that kinda stuff. And they beat it in with horrifying images of sexual diseases that really should not have been shown to 11 and 12 year olds. I then moved on to a catholic high school, and from there we went from sex is bad to sex is a sin and if you touch yourself god will punish you. I was never religious but I'm very impressionable. Throughout my whole highschool career I suppressed all my sexual urges because I didn't want to be punished by a magical spirit I wasn't even sure I believed in, but hey, why risk it?  Now I'm out of highschool, and I first realized how repressed I was when my sister-in-law (drunkenly) offered to take me to buy a vibrator. I thought it was a joke, but it became clear that she was concerned about my lack of sexual desire. I couldn't go. I still can't go. I've tried to change things for myself, but any time I try to... yknow... have fun with myself, I start to feel guilty and I want to cry. Every time I feel aroused I subconsciously do something to distract myself from unpure thoughts. Why do I do this though? It's not religion, I'm an atheist now (other than believing in reincarnation). I'm really concerned because I have a boyfriend now and I'm worried that when it comes down to our time to shine, I'll break down and ruin everything. Can anyone help me? Should I talk to my psychiatrist or mental health nurse? It's just so embarrassing..."
I tend to watch Jim Henson's memorial when I want to feel upset. Or if I'm mildly upset already.
"Everything I used to like bores me and everything else is a pain to do. I have to force myself to do the basic tasks like brushing my teeth. I spend most of my time laying in bed fantasizing about things that I'd like to happen. Sometimes I hate myself and sometimes I think I'm the best thing in the world and that everyone else is below me. I couldn't kill myself but often I have fantasies of dying in accidents such as robberies or car crashes.  I would like to get help but I'm unsure of where to start. I just got health insurance and it covers behavioral health. Under the options of providers there are so many choices. Psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, behavioral analysts, counselors, etc. Who do I see for help and what do I say to them?"
"Hello! I'm Amanda, a teacher at a school for teens with Behavioral Health problems. Grades (US) are 5-12, I teach 8th grade.  I work with kids who have been through the ringer, 4 times and back. Usually hospitalized multiple times, some are in the foster system.   Any advice, anything I should know, any ideas,"
"I've been having a pretty bad time lately... there's nothing 'wrong' in my life, as such, I'm just in a really bad place for seemingly no reason with what appears to be nowhere to turn. A warning in advance, this post will likely be quite long and anyone 'triggered' by self harm or suicidal thoughts should stop reading.   I've been depressed since I was 12. It took six years for doctors to actually listen to me and stop treating me like an attention seeking child. Due to my young age, they left me untreated and only offered me questionnaires rather than counselling or medication. Those questionnaires included generic questions where you circled a number between one to ten for your answer. Nothing came of the questionnaires. I became an alcoholic aged 14. I made friends with older people and started acting out. I also started self harming. I got arrested and put on suicide watch. That got me noticed for all of two minutes, with one doctors appointment being given to me to see if my self harming required treatment. It apparently didn't as my cries for help continued to be ignored. I eventually had a mental breakdown in November 2014 where I tried to kill myself in my work place. I slashed at my wrists ready for everything to be over. Unfortunately, the Stanley knife I was using was too blunt to do any real damage. The next day I was put on antidepressants and diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety with social phobia. It took me trying to kill myself for doctors to take me seriously. That was over two years ago.   In those two years, I have had numerous breakdowns, episodes where I've self harmed, been on the verge of developing an eating disorder and seriously contemplated suicide.   I went to the doctors yesterday due to my medication no longer being effective. I begged my doctor to change my medication or give me something to take as well as. They refused because 'only a psychiatrist' can prescribe additional medication. Instead, they put me on the maximum dosage to see if it would work. It won't. They've basically just left me waiting for the medication to fail again... only then will they change what medication I'm on to something that may actually work. I also mentioned that I qualify for having up to four personality disorders and asked to be put forward to speak to someone so I could potentially get a diagnosis. They refused that too, because 'it doesn't look good on your record'. I don't care how it looks... I want to know exactly what's wrong with me so that I can accept who I am and what I have, so that I can learn to deal with it and find ways to live a 'normal' life based on my needs. That wasn't a valid enough reason, apparently. My medical records appearance shouldn't really be of any concern either as, prior to my asking whether I could get put forward for being diagnosed, my doctor told me they didn't think I would ever be able to go back to working.   Anyway, I also mentioned how, I've been having a constant thought run through my mind - If this is going to be my life, what is the point?. This is due to the fact that I am 21 years old, I've been this 'ill' since I was 18... I got good grades in school and started working towards my degree aged 16. I had prospects. I was going to make something of myself... I was going to make my parents proud of me. Proud that I'd listened to them when I was growing up, and that I'd made the right choices in the end. Proud that I had done things they never did. Proud that I had become a lawyer/doctor/broker/computer genius like they had dreamed. Instead? I'm claiming benefits so that I can afford to pay my bills. I'm living with my mum and sharing a bedroom with my younger sister. My mum has to physically put food in front of me so that I eat because I forget or I have no motivation to actually make something. I have to have someone with me so that I can leave my house. I dropped out of university because I couldn't concentrate and was missing assignments. I have one friend in the entire world because everyone else, even my best friend of 18 years, walked away as soon as I went from bad to worse. In a matter of years, I have gone from having the chance to be somebody and making something of myself, to being an agoraphobic nervous wreck that has nothing to show from their life. The doctors response to my quoting of my thought? Oh, dear. That is all they said. They didn't care how I felt... they didn't offer any options to help me break this chain of thought.   Onto now. I am fighting the urge to cut myself. I had the same urge last night, although I didn't act upon it. Tonight? I dragged a pair of blunt scissors across my skin to try to quench the urges by providing my body with the sensation of cutting without actually harming myself. It didn't work, and the urges are now stronger than ever. I'm suicidal but not at the same time, if that even makes any sense. I don't want to be here anymore... I don't see the point in living a half life anymore. I'm not living, I'm just alive. I've gone around and around in circles for years, and always ended up right where I started. I want to die... but I also hold onto the hope that one day I'll wake up and I'll live. Actually, live. Whenever I feel like this, I think of my family. My mum, my sister and my brother. My dad, who I don't see as often as I'd like, but love dearly. My grandmother, who is my best friend. She lives abroad, so I don't see her as often as I used to and I don't get to speak to her as often as I'd like either. My pets. I also think of my friend. I think of how my death would affect them... each of them. Individually. My parents would mourn the loss of their eldest child; their baby. My siblings would mourn the loss of their sister, and have to watch our parents grieve me. My pets, whilst they wouldn't grieve as such, would wonder where I was and why I hadn't come home to them. Why I wasn't there to give them their cuddles, or tell them I love them, or play with them. My friend would grieve a friend she had known since primary school, someone who had stood by her when nobody else did, who had supported her in everything. My grandmother? She would grieve her eldest grandchild. Her secret favourite, as she likes to say. She would grieve until the grief eventually took her life. For those reasons, I don't think I could ever go through with killing my self. No matter how bad I get, no matter how hard I try to not think of those reasons and just do it... my mind always goes back to them.   That is why I am going insane. I am stuck in a constant turmoil of harming myself, wanting to kill myself, realising how killing myself would harm those I love and repeat. I want some form of release from this hell that is my life. I just want my thoughts to shut of for 5 minutes so that I can relax and just feel some peace. My doctor won't refer me to see a psychiatrist as they don't want to 'go down that road'. Instead, they'd rather have me continue living like this, taking medication that doesn't work and suffering.   I sometimes feel like I need to be sectioned. Not for my own safety, but so that I can get the right treatment. Proper treatment. Treatment that will work. Treatment that will teach me a way to live, properly live, and show me the way to recovery. However, my doctor is unwilling to refer me for talk therapy with a counsellor or psychiatrist, let alone order me into a mental health unit. I wouldn't want to check myself into one either, because often, checking yourself in can lead to you not getting proper treatment.   I just feel empty. Like I'm dead inside and just going through the motions, and I can't find a way out. To give a visual on my feelings, imagine there's a body. Inside that body, is hollow apart from a metal frame (much like a robot). You go to the head, and where the brain should be, are controls instead. There's a tube on the side of the skull labelled 'serotonin' which has been blocked off so that the serotonin can't get through the tube. In the back of the skull, is a cage. I'm locked in that cage. Controlling my body? A black figure that appears almost smoke like. It has no face. It's unidentifiable but it's there. It's depression.   I know this is extremely long, and I truly thank anyone that has actually bothered to read through to this point, but this is my cry for help. I need serious advice on how to go forward. How to get my doctors to listen to me. How to get proper treatment. How to get 'better' in a way that allows me to live. Anything. Please.   (I described my life prior to what is happening in the present, so as to show that my illness is true and I have been dealing with it for quite some time. Also to show how I've dealt with it badly and made some terrible decisions that I don't wish to repeat.)"
"So I'm not sure if this is where to post this or not but I am slowly losing what little shreds of actual self worth I have left. I suffer from chronic illness and since April of 2016 it seems that everything has gone downhill.   After a hellish few years since graduating with my bachelors degree I thought I had got everything back under control, at least on the health aspect of life, and I began Grad school. The first semester was great, I was in a program I loved, I had my own apartment, was finally living the life I had wanted. The second semester rolls around and there were a few bumps that I dealt with over winter break but otherwise life was still good, I managed to secure a job at the university I was attending, and though I was taking a heavier course load I felt like I was thriving. The health issues started to flare about February and the doctor I was seeing scheduled a surgery for the start of April in hopes of avoiding complications...of course life decided to totally screw me over and during surgery there were complications. My health insurance dropped me due to my birthday and the COBRA option took its sweet time taking over, leaving me without one of my treatments (without this particular treatment I have no immune system). Between the surgical complications and the absence of my immune system I was confined to what amounted to seclusion for over 3 months. During that timeframe my only real interaction was with my immediate family and roughly 3 friends who I would only have the ability to talk to remotely. My chronic pain only continued to worsen but I managed to convince myself I could handle it and so I tried returning to the life I had (school, my own place, etc). I got lucky enough to secure medical evaluation at the Mayo Clinic and had worked out time away from classes for the time I'd be out of state for those appointments...it turned out that what originally was set for one week had expanded to two, still doable but with higher risk. I should have known better but I got my hopes up that maybe these experts would have an answer to the medical problems...they didn't. Needless to say I was devastated, I was basically told that as a 26 year old I was just going to have to learn to live with the intense daily pain. Stupid me thought I would be able to blow it off and manage to pull off at least a passable attempt at the life I had finally had a taste of. So I came home, drug my ass out of bed even though I could barely stand to be touched by my own clothes, and crashed and burned in the typical fashion of my life. I ended up in a hospital for 29 days because I didn't listen to my body and ended up with aseptic meningitis as well as a immune system failure. That brings me to where I am now...I HAD a life and now I am reduced to sharing a bed with my mom in her one bedroom apartment, living off a handful of clothes that I had brought with me for what was supposed to be a weekend visit back at the beginning of October (most of which no longer fit thanks to pain medication aided weight gain), almost all of my personal belongings sitting in the apartment Im still paying rent on, and any human interaction that isn't with my mother, grandmother, or uncle is almost exclusively through text because I physically cannot go out in public without being exhausted after a mere 20 minutes. My typical day is spent alone because my mom generally is out with her current boyfriend (even when she IS home it seems like she's always talking to him or someone else on her phone). It feels like she's rubbing it in my face that even she has more friends than me, even though I'm sure that's just my imagination. Right now we have a gofundme going because I was actually accepted into a chronic pain therapy program but I would be financially responsible for housing during the month long program length, she keeps getting frustrated when I veto certain pictures...maybe I am being unreasonable but I'd like to hold onto whatever dignity I can, even if it is purely for vanity's sake. I was overweight before all of this started but since the month in the hospital I have been relegated to shirts that always fit a little too tight to look decent and stretch pants that only serve to accent my lack of muscle tone and excess of fat rolls. I'm seriously at the verge of completely losing any ability to give a damn about what happens to me. I'm tired of hurting, tired of living in thrift store shirts and dollar store sweats, tired of going to doctors only to have them give up or refuse any possible intervention, tired of being shuffled between my moms and my grandmothers, tired of being alone, and most of all I'm tired of feeling as worthless as I do. I want the life that I finally had made for myself back but it's starting to become apparent that I'm never going to have any semblance of normalcy."
"I've been in an inpatient ICU mental hospital for the past week due to severe anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, hallucinations, and intrusive thoughts that mostly involve suicidal ideation and thoughts of hurting myself. I also have a compulsion to claw at and pick at my skin. Not actively suicidal luckily.  Anyway. I was discharged 7 hours ago, and already feel like this was a mistake, that I never should have left the hospital. Two of my family members have already driven me to wishing I could stop existing, crying, and a massive meltdown. They had shown support while I was in, but now they're being extremely critical and abusive with their words, and I'm just...heartbroken. I needed that support and encouragement for my recovery. I was so determined and confident when I was discharged and now all that confidence is gone.  I really don't know what to do...I can't go back to the hospital tonight, the facility is over 2hrs away from where I live, and my only ride is one of the two people who turned cruel. And since I'm not a danger to myself I can't justify calling for an ambulance, and would certainly just get further criticised for it and for the ambulance fees. I can't afford any other mode of transportation either, so I'm just stuck at home. My brain's just drawing blanks, I need help or advice, please.  I have an appointment set up with my therapist on the 2nd, waiting on my case manager to call back with info when she can get me an appointment with a psychiatrist as well, but I likely won't be able to see one for a few weeks."
"We've had an appointment made for a month. I was so excited but after filling out the paperwork tonight I just don't want to go...   Backstory: About 12 months ago we found out the little boy I was pregnant with would have severe disabilities. We love him so much, but my experiences during pregnancy and after his birth have been so traumatic that I now have trauma and fear associated with almost all things pregnancy/hospital/newborn related. We want so desperately to someday have a large family, but now I am very scared of my next pregnancy (we aren't planning any children currently, though) and having to go through all of this again- not being able to hold my baby for a week, not feed him for two, send his little body into surgery, watch him aspirate and need oxygen multiple times, spending hours a week with insurance and medical bills...   Anyway. Life is beautiful and he is doing well. But after doing all this paperwork and seeing the cost (which we can afford but I still don't want to pay) I just want to cancel the appointment. These things hurt so much and I don't even think my husband realises how much trauma there is in my heart. I would honestly rather keep it bottled up inside and pretend like I have it together. You know? Is there anyone else who can relate? Any encouragement? I am so upset and I feel I have no one else to ask who will be patient with me."
"Let me begin by telling you that I'm not sure what is going on. I feeling like I have been on about a 4 year long slump. I don't want to try and diagnose myself, so I am here to get the help of the lovely people of reddit.  So I am a 17 year-old dude with a normalish background. My parents got divorced about 2.5 years ago and that was a bit rough but even before that I felt my life was kinda fucked. Ever since the time I was about 13 things have gone down hill. When I was 13ish some of my friends had been hopitalized after attempts on their lives or for self harm. That was the begining of things, in the following 4 years I've been through some stuff, my parents divorce, unhealthy relationship (She threatened to kill herself if I left), that girlfriend atempting suicide, my friend attempting suicide 3 time in a year, family members getting hospitalized, losing my job and most recently a feeling that everyone in my life is going away from me. In the middle of all this I have become uninterested in just about everything, I've lost most of my self esteem, I've lost all self confidence and occasionally I'll start to hyperventilate and I lose the ability to move and just lay there and cry. My close friends have told me to go talk to a professional but I am too embaresed. I thought you guys could tell me how to cope or something.  I know many people on here have their own problems that are probably way more important than mine but I just need one person who can help."
"I seem to like being an emotional masochistic. Can any tell me why? Growing up I've always been in relationships which would cause a great deal of emotional pain. Then as I got older I started noticing that, whenever I was starting to feel down. I look for anything and everything to make myself feel worse. Most of it was from watching soul crushing shows. Most nights I'd go to bed listening to songs that remind of sad stories or moments. I don't know why, I'd just seem to sleep better while feeling like I was to die."
"I don't really know where to start and I've never really done this before, but I'm so desperate. So I've always had a problem with anger, and I'm pretty sure it all stems from my insecurities. When I was younger I got picked on a lot. It was my family and friends who did it. They were never extremely mean about it, but it was always them pointing out something I was insecure about. I honestly don't think any of them realized what they were doing. I remember when I was about ten years old, I started self harming. At that age, I would just pull my hair out, scratch my legs up, and hit myself in the head. I hated myself and so I guess it was me taking my anger out on myself. I would always tell myself that I had to change because no one liked me, I was weird and annoying. This thought process has remained the same, the only difference now is that I've gone from scratching my legs to cutting them. I get easily frustrated with myself, I tell myself I'm stupid and fat and ugly. Over little things, too. And the worst part is not only do I take this frustration out on myself, but on the people I love the most. Because of this, I'm ruining relationships. I've lost my ex because of this. Thankfully, I now have someone who is better for me but it's getting to be too much for him as well. Today we were out on a date and I got upset over something so tiny. I can't even remember why. But I could feel so much anger and hatred for myself and I was so so mean to him. And then I got angry for acting the way I did, which only made it worse. I eventually calmed down and tried to make it better by being super sweet and apologizing, and he forgave me but he told me that he can't deal with this forever. Keep in mind that he's always been extremely supportive of me and has tried his best to help me with this. He's been so patient and sweet. But there's only so much a person can handle. It happens nearly every day we're together. And we've had this same conversation a few times before. And I always say I'm gonna change, it works for about a week or so, then I slip back into that habit of just. Anger. And sadness and feeling insecure and just being so horrible and mean to him and other people I love. But mostly him because he's the one I'm around the most and I feel so guilty. Why can't I just stop it? I have such a good thing and I know I'll lose him if I don't get better. Also I want to point out that I'm not just wanting to change for him, but for myself as well. I don't want to be this way. It's so miserable. It's just this cycle, over and over and over again. And it's become such a habit that I don't even realize what's happening until afterwards. And then I feel incredibly guilty and stupid because it shouldn't be so damn hard to just not be a bitch and to stay calm, right? But it's so hard for me to just not let things get to me. I feel like I've lost complete control of my emotions. I want to be happy and feel good about myself and I want to be sweet and good to the people I love because the angry me is not the real me. I feel like it's a completely different person. My boyfriend suggested I get professional help for this because it's such a hard thing for me and he thinks I could really benefit from it, but I don't know where to start or if I'd even be able to completely open up, face to face, to someone I don't know. I don't see how people do it. If anyone has been through anything like this or is currently going through it, please help me. I'm tired of it. So so tired."

"I am incredibly suicidal. I've basically just had enough of everyone and everything. I moved back home with my overbearing mother, and I can't stand it. I moved out for a reason all those years ago. Due to mental health issues, I was unable to maintain living on my own or even keep my job. So now I am on welfare and trying to get disability, and living with my mother.  I can't even go to hospital. The way it works where I am, if you want inpatient care, you have to go to the hospital that is in your catchment area. each suburb is assigned to a catchment area and the nearest hospital is where you'll be sent if you're out of that catchment area for anything other than ermegency stuff.  So I can't go to my local hospital, because it fucking sucks arse and they called me a liar when I was being seen there quite a number of years ago. Yes, I'm sure it has changed since then, since it has been over 5 years since I was a patient there, but that doesn't change the fact that they called me a liar, among other things.  Anyway, that isn't that pertinent to my post. I am feeling incredibly suicidal and just had enough. I have an appointment in about a week and a half with the welfare office to find out whether I am able to get my disability, and if I can get that then I can move the fuck away from this fucking hell hole of a living situation.  In the mean time, I am trying, and seemingly failing, to not self harm or suicide or one of the many other bad tools I used to use to cope with distressing situations. I seem to have dug myself into a hole that I am unable to get myself out of in the foreseeable future.  Anyway, if anyone reads this, thanks for reading my rant. Don't have a lot of people to rant at, so here I am... yet again."
"For the longest time, I thought journaling was an ineffective coping skill. I had the belief it would only cause me to ruminate more of the bad thoughts running through my head. Sadly, I let this thought get the better of me which is a shame since I actually love writing.   When I was hospitalized for having a plan for suicide a second time, my roommate journaled. A sweet nurse suggested I try it too. I gave it a chance and have not looked back. I'm not always consistent, but it does wonders when I do.  I have learned that journaling gets out and stops the thoughts. After I write it, I tend not to ruminate on it. I've also had some pretty big self realization like the kind I had in therapy through journaling which is great because I currently cannot afford a therapist.   Anyone else find that journal is a useful coping skill?"
"Many times I appear very rude even though I try my best not to. People say my body language shows disinterest and I look bothered by people. I'm also not good at small talk, I constantly avoid it and don't know how to carry a fluid small talk conversation/introduction. I also gave trouble making eye contact.  I'm frustrated and don't know how to improve my body language"
"Some background: I have been with my boyfriend Charlie for nearly a year now. We met because we both live and work at an environmental education center in a relatively isolated location. Due to our current circumstances, we essentially were living together from Day 1. This has come with challenges but we've made it work. Much of our relationship has been wonderful and I have never been with a partner I was so sure I could see building a life with...But now we're hitting a crisis point and I don't know what to do.  I've struggled on and off with anxiety and depression for several years and it's a continuous journey figuring out how best to deal with it. This summer I started getting the worst anxiety attacks of my life and it began to affect our relationship. I started seeing a therapist weekly and I'm doing all I can to get better, but honestly I just feel like I'm in a downward spiral. Charlie, while never having delt with chronic mental health challenges before, has tried his best to be a supportive partner. We're now at a point where we're both absolutely exhausted from dealing with this. I feel like a shell of myself and it's a struggle just to get through the day. I moved to this state for my current job, and a challenge for me has been not being able to establish much of a community beyond my workplace/home...So Charlie, outside of my therapist and family living on the other side of the country, has been one of my only support systems.  Several months ago, we began to make plans to move to another state and live together. It seemed perfect: He lived there for three years in the past, so we have a super sweet community with similar interests to land with. We both have job options up there at different places (his is confirmed; mine is in the works). Not working where we live and being in a larger town will allow me to do more activities on my own, make new friends and generally build support networks outside of my relationship. My therapist has even offered to do sessions online until I'm able to get set up with another therapist in our new town. Plus I get to be near MOUNTAINS, which makes me oh-so-happy. Despite the struggles we've been going through, I've been super excited to intentionally build a home with a partner for the first time and take the next step while also allowing our relationship some breathing room. We've been communicating openly about these plans since our initial decision to move there.  It's now 2 weeks before we're supposed to move. We're wrapping up our current positions, training our replacements and slowly packing up our lives. We're both under a lot of stress, and I've been a complete wreck--horrible and frequent anxiety attacks when Charlie simply doesn't have the capacity to deal with it. We've had arguments, frank discussions, times of just holding each other and crying, you name it. A few nights ago Charlie firmly but kindly said he still wants to to the new town together, but thinks we should move into separate houses. (Our original plan was to land with friends for month while we look for our own place together.) His reasoning is that he's scared our relationship is going to crash and burn otherwise; that he needs space to heal and thinks I could use it too; that we'd still be dating but would have more space to be individuals. All of these points make sense and all I want is for him to be happy and have his needs met after months of focusing on mine. On the other hand, I'm freaking out. This is a very different plan from our months of building towards the move. I don't even know if I'd want to live with new roommates that I haven't met. I pictured the move as really good in many ways for my mental health regardless (as described above) and I honestly can't say if living with him or without him seems like the better move for me at this point. I also feel like I don't have a choice in the matter. This new information had caused my anxiety to ramp up even more and we've been having conflicts every night. He's sleeping on the couch tonight and I'm devastated. Part of me wonders if this is the beginning of the end and if it's really stupid of me to even move up there at all. The problem is that if I didn't, I don't even know where to go or what to do. I would be completely heartbroken to lose him.  What makes it even harder is that no one has even done anything wrong in this situation. We're both two people trying to be kind to each other and do our best, but we're both hurting and frustrated. What do I do, Reddit? What do you make of this situation? Any words of wisdom or support?  TL;DR: I've been struggling with the worst panic attacks of my life and it's affecting my relationship with my boyfriend of 1 year. Two weeks before we are supposed to move to another state together, bf says he wants to move up together but live in separate houses. We're both at breaking points and I feel backed into a corner and out of options. What do I do?"
"I haven't always been like this. recently I started working, which is great! But I've noticed that being surrounded by so many people just makes me feel physically ill. I get home and want to just expel everything from my stomach. what is wrong with me? Why am I like this?"
My sister was prescribed antidepressants when she went to the doctor for some back pains. My whole family wants her to take them as she has a lot of issues just coping with day to day life. She refuses to take them though as she thinks they are bad for her and that she knows best and can solve all of her problems on her own. does anyone have any experience with gettings someone to take their medicine when they don't want to?
"I have an escapism addiction I developed as a coping mechanism from growing up bipolar and in an abusive environment. I've been trying to kick the habit for a while now, but most of my hobbies are things like reading, watching TV, or playing video games where it's too easy to get lost in them. So I'm looking for some new hobbies that will help me stay conscious and in the present.  I am an artist and like to draw, but I'm currently trying to pursue that professionally and would like a fun, stress-free hobby outside of that. So far I like the idea of coloring, especially since some of the artists I admire will occasionally release free coloring pages. It's also something I can do with my 3yo.  Any other ideas?"
"Can someone be a little bit DID, or is that like being a little bit pregnant? Is there a spectrum, or is DID one of those things that a person just has or doesn't have?  Like, for example, can someone have kind of alters, that act and speak differently but aren't entirely out of the awareness of the main personality, which can exert some control? Up to and including fighting off the alter personality? Or is that just an example of an over-imaginative person (at best) or manipulative person (at worst)?  Trying to Google for this comes up with all sorts of stuff that is either pop psych or so technical as to be impenetrable to me.   Edit: Because typing is hard."
"I've had addiction issues stemming out of a rough childhood. I'm sober now and I'm doing other counseling treatment but the isolation is not going away any time soon. I do meetups and try to spend as much time out of the house as I can. At the end of the day I'm still alone. Go to bed alone, wake up alone, eat alone, do everything alone.   I've made lists of numbers of specialists to talk to and wondering what category of specialists might specialize in social skills and dealing with chronic isolation.  I'm 35 and since I was a child I have felt unlovable and completely ignorable. I need to accept that and could use the right person to talk me into the right frame of mind."
"I'm in a competitive major at fairly competitive university and am studying to get into PA school. I'm currently taking Biochem and OChem in the same semester on top of two other classes as well as taking on a part time EMT-B job.   My friends always remark that I look tired, sad, or even angry even when I'm not trying to be. I guess subconsciously I'm dead on the inside because I'm always worrying about my grades and not letting down my parents, so maybe that's what they're seeing.   I'm a pretty personable guy and love to go out and party and do normal college kid stuff, but I always find myself getting annoyed with my friends for no reason and they always say I'm being a dick. I don't know how to fix this considering I don't try to be a dick, but I guess I just come off as one these days and it's really depressing and just another thing hanging over my head.   Any tips on how to self-improve my life would be more than greatly appreciated."
"So this is the first time I've ever spoken about my fears of having Anxiety/Depression so I'm sorry if it's not allowed here but just wanted your guys' opinion.   Once in September or so I was feeling down and started to think it was just a bad mood until it carried on for the past 4-5 months. I am generally a really upbeat, happy go lucky person. However it just snowballed into how I feel today. So these are the 'symptoms' I have:  - Constantly feel empty emotionally.  - Even though I know people will listen to my problems I don't want to burden them with my problems and make them think I'm weak.  - Put on an act when around people, fake emotions to draw away suspicion.  - Very tired, over sleep and find it difficult to fall asleep  - Lack of confidence which is the exact opposite of how I normally am.  - Dislike attention being drawn to me in any way.  - Socially awkward but can switch it off and appear outgoing when I want to be.  - tend to hate myself and how I am and how I look.  - Very negative attitude about most things apart from one.  - Feel like I have let my loved ones down and don't want to tell them so they don't think less of me.  - Don't have high hopes for the future.  - Now, I had never thought about killing myself and still don't apart from one occasion for a few minutes.  - Often 1-2 times a week feel like running away from everything I have and just wanting to be alone or start again.  I feel stupid whenever I feel like I should talk to my doctor and wouldn't even know what to say and I don't know if I should. Just wondering what people here though. So, again, sorry if this isn't allowed. All help is appreciated, thanks!"

"Hi- first time poster here, so I'm really sorry if I mess up any formatting.  Originally I wrote pages but nobody would read it so I'll try and keep this short. My mental health has always been a bit up and down but right now anxiety is pounding my ass like a porno hoe. these are what im currently going through:  -feeling of terror in the day; like I've just seen the horror movie creature behind me but I forget it instantly, just that feeling. ever seen that old episode of doctor who lol? like that  -the feeling when you miss a step on the stairs in the dark, on loop.  -constant high pulse and adrenalin; can't sleep at night, have done all nighters but not because i wanted to. can you believe people pay money for drugs that do this?  -constant nausea to the extent of weight loss because I can't eat. again. fashion models eat your heart out  -i've seen people in real life; i come off perhaps a little bit weird but i don't break. im too good at this  -constant fear of properly breaking; i dont want to mess up my life and have to quit college so i cant afford to break. i have a recurring terror of suddenly hallucinating/breaking from reality/having my perception become more warped than it usually is.  -minor shakes; this is new.   -generally very scared  i've been in a bad state before and managed to pull out of it; once (though this time did have a good reason), i went four days absolutely messed up, cried hard for the first time in years then was still anxious but a lot better than i'd been. so embarrassing after; only one person saw, but thank fuck i never talk to them.  At the moment I'm all sorts of illogical; scared to use brands of shampoo because I'm afraid that I'll associate the smell of them with this period of time (??? please don't laugh haha), small things becoming incredibly overwhelming.  I was on the bus the other day and I honestly thought I was going to die. I was there like... the world is honestly breaking and so am I. sweaty, high pulse, the lot.  I have to get through this-- I can't afford for my family to know I have mental illnesses and I can't fail. How do I get through this?  Please give me advice; I'm not good at expressing myself but I'm in a very fragile place. Coping mechanisms, those kinds of things.  Thank-you  tdlr: anxiety is kicking my ass"
"As the title mentions my therapist suggested yesterday (after 2.5 years together) that she has brought on a new clinician to her practice and suggested that I should switch over to her if I wanted and that if I didn't like her or if I didn't even want to try and make the move that I could certainly remain with her. Her body language and overall tone suggested that she was just trying to be polite and lighten the blow of this news that I could continue seeing her, which felt half-hearted and slightly fake.   I should add that a month ago I finally broke down and told her about how severe my suicidal thoughts have been over the past month or two with worsening depression. Suicide has never been a topic with us and she took it better than I expected. I've only seen her twice since I brought that topic up and now just yesterday she brings up that she thinks I should move on to this new clinician she has brought on to her practice.  I can't help but feel that this is her polite way of terminating our relationship and I can't help but think that it could be brought on since I mentioned my deepening suicidal thoughts, if it something else she is bothered by me about, or if she is lightening her patient load due to personal issues ongoing with her. I've read that a lot of clinicians don't like suicidal patients due to what could possibly happen and they will remove themselves from that person  Writing this to see if anyone else in this sub has had a similar experience or any advice since this is making my depression even worse than it already is.   Thank you in advance to anyone who responds to this."
I want it to stop.
"I'm feeling worse than I have in a long, long time. I am completely numb. I actually cut myself whilst in the bath purely to feel SOMETHING... I barely felt anything. The room was steaming yet I felt like the water was freezing. It's like I'm inside my body but I'm not attached to it.   I couldn't take sitting in silence downstairs with my family anymore so I came to bed, but not to sleep. To cry. Cry about everything. Cry about the fact that my parents don't ask my how I am, but they will ask my sister. Cry about the fact that nobody notices that I'm dead behind the eyes, but notice if my siblings have a tantrum. Cry about the fact that nobody cares enough to check on me. Cry for the lack of love and compassion that I'm shown. Cry for the lack of ears willing to listen to my cries for help.   I can't take this pain anymore. I can't take just being alive and not living life how I should be. I can't take the suffering. I'm exhausted. I don't want to be here. I just want peace because although I feel nothing, I feel everything.   I sat and thought about how it would affect my family, properly thought. They'd cry a little, they'd grieve... but they'd get used to it. I barely see my grandmother, my father and my sister... it's only really my mother and brother that see me daily and even then interaction is minimal. I like to think that when I do eventually take my life (I'm not saying I'm going to do it today, tomorrow or next week but I can feel within myself that I will take my life one day), that they will be happy for me. Happy that I'm finally at peace, that my suffering is over and that I'm not hurting anymore. I hope that they'd see that it wasn't their fault... not really.   In a brief moment when the tears stopped and I was at a whole new level of numb, I was holding the t-shirt that I'd been using to wipe my eyes and my nose and I saw myself tying it around my neck before double knotting it quickly. I struggled a little bit trying to undo the knots as I ran out of air and then with a final sigh of air leaving my lungs I was gone. Just like that. I thought of how easy it would be to just do it. To just tie it around my neck and lay there until there's no air left, but then I thought of how it would affect either my mother or my brother when they found my corpse... and also the fact it would have to be investigated of murder. It would be bad enough for them to deal with my death, let alone get accused of killing me.   I laid and listened to my mother come up the stairs, hoping that she would come into my room and find me crying. Hoping that she would finally ask me what was wrong so that I could break and let everything pour out and hopefully get some help. Instead? She went straight into her room. This made me cry harder because I remembered the days when she used to pop her head around my door every night. I remembered the days when she cared if her child was still alive on the other side of the door. Not anymore.   I'm beginning to accept that I may need to be sectioned... either by self admittance or forced admittance, I'm no longer bothered. It's just a matter of getting to the point where people will take me seriously enough and actually notice me, to see that I need professional help. Unfortunately for me, the only person that truly cares about my mental health is thousands of miles away in a completely different country. Even my doctor won't listen to how bad I actually am.   It scares me because I don't know which will come first. Death? Or help? Believe me when I say, I want to live. I want to have my life and live it to its fullest. I have hopes and dreams. BUT, I can't live with this illness without getting some serious help. I haven't got the energy to stay strong anymore... I'm truly exhausted and I've properly given up."
"I just was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I had a pretty rough childhood and life. I've done meditation and therapy. Now I'm on meds 10 mg of mint escitalopram. I was having some serious anxiety, ptsd and depression. What does wveryone elses anxiety feel like and where does it come from!"
"OK so this all happened between 6pm yesterday, and about 1am this morning. This is not made up, this is what happened to me. I began feeling tingly and strange around 6pm, I got tingly and it felt like something was pushing on different parts of my body. I realized after a while that I was possessed by a demon. It's hard to explain how I got to this line of thinking, I'm sober in recovery and take psychiatric meds. But anyway, it was as real as anything. It started getting worse, some examples: -I began trying to get on my phone but the keypad only let me type 666. no other number worked.  -There was a strong pull on different parts of my body, when I asked a question, my head would feel heavy and nod or shake.  -I saw a phone move across a table away from me -I began to think that the only way to get help was to recite prayers, hail Mary's and our father's and the serenity prayer. I'm not religious, never have been. I began gooogling exorcism prayers. -this whole time I'm in a house with a few other people, but I didn't let anybody see cause I didn't want to get locked up in the mental ward. I new all this was crazy, but I couldn't dismiss the evidence I was seeing. -there were too many instances to count, a Buddhist statue waisted it's hands to me. lights turned red, the fan light flickered, papers moves, all this was as real as this phone at the timw.  I acted normal and went to an AA meeting, and for the entire house I was battling this demon in my head sitting perfectly still except when I'd twitch from the mental strain. Long story short, I talked myself into realizing none of this was real. I was seeing demons on the floor and in the air near me. I'd describe them as things HP Lovecraft would dream up. But sanity prevaled. I had strong strong hallucinations till I fell asleep, small monsters on my body, spiders in the window. I just focused on my phone screen till I passed out. I was fatigued but fine this morning. I don't know what happened to me. please help."
"I have a history (since I was a kid) of anxiety and depression. I've been told by a couple of medical practitioners to look into therapy after they commented that I have a lack of affect.   The problem is that I also have a history with therapy, and it's... unpleasant. I wrote something stupid for class that got me landed in therapy that I never felt I needed. I was resentful and paranoid that the therapist was reporting everything I said to my parents. Also, when driving my home, my dad would ask, What did you talk about today? which just furthered my suspicions.  Eventually, I was allowed to stop going, but after that if I misbehaved it was like a threat: Do we need to send you back to therapy? Usually the misbehavior came from my frustrations that they weren't understanding me, so I felt that they were the ones at fault, so when they sent me to another therapist- and put me on antidepressants at 11- I interpreted this as a punishment.  Now, I have some of the same issues following me around, but I find the idea of going to therapy traumatic. It's like admitting I'm not acting right for society, and I have to go get myself fixed. Objectively, I know I'm not okay- I'm anxious, I feel vaguely guilty over nothing specific, I have difficulty getting excited, I don't sleep well, and I have difficulty motivating myself to do things. I just don't know how to get over this roadblock."
"So lately I've been depressed. This is a recurring thing from 2014, from when it vanished and came back in earlier 2016.  All I do is sleep, eat junk, and think about dying all the time. I know I have a problem.  But the problem is I hate psychiatrists. They always seemed so condescending to me, like bad listeners, and like they just see you as a paycheck. I never saw one that didn't treat me like my problems were trivial and/or didn't just say mhm every fifteen minutes without offering any insight or help.  Not only that, but I don't want to be that guy who was so weak they just couldn't handle their poor feelings so much.  Is there any place I can go for help that isn't a psychologist or loaded gun?"
"Hi there, I'm not 100% sure how to start but I tend to ramble so I'll try my hardest to keep things short   I feel like a constant disappointment. I have high expectations of myself and so do my parents since I'm an only child and they're such hard workers. Neither of them have dealt with mental health issues in the past (their words not my judgement) and so when I was diagnosed (after along time of invalidation) they were very confused. In my childhood things were very strict and I was constantly walking on eggshells around them, juggling keeping my dad happy (which has made a lot of weird behaviour for me now) and getting good grades.  One abusive relationship later and leaving school and 5 years of suicidal thoughts and attempts later; I am an escapist, constantly making up lies as to why I can't do certain things so I can stay at home and be cool and do errands from here. I have depression, anxiety, ptsd and mildly autistic I feel like I'm a terrible person, particularly because of my escapist behaviour (I've stayed at my boyfriends house for a month and visited my parents twice just because it's so tense being there sometimes even though things have calmed down) and often want to self harm (but have promised not too due to partner)  I am not financially independent, despite trying my absolute hardest to get a job, and every time I see my parents that's the topic of conversation for at least an hour and, despite also pursuing higher education  When I go over there they say how much they miss me and both want constant affection and I feel very overwhelmed and tired much faster than I do for normal social interactions, probably because of how tense my childhood was (my dad would stare at me angrily from the couch if I walked into the kitchen and quietly got myself a glass of water because I was being too loud)  This breaks my mums heart and I don't want to do that, I don't like that I feel so tense and can get snappy just from feeling so much more exhausted than I do with any other social interaction  I just way to be left alone and not feel like even if I walk into the house and talk proudly about what I'm doing with education and looking for work, they'll bring up something I haven't seen or haven't thought about and by the end I'll feel like a failure who hasn't even been trying.   Despite currently getting ready for school, mum wants me to get a full time job since the reason she thinks I'm not getting hired  This is despite me telling her at my last full time job (while in abusive relationship may I add) I constantly wanted to die and on multiple occasions considered overdosing at my desk.   They help me financially currently, well my mum and it's in secret, for me cleaning the house. I don't want this situation any more and need to be more independent  I just I feel like a bad person and my brain is so sick with constant chatter and terrible self esteem and body image ranging from stuff in childhood to how (dad saying he could see my cellulite in my shorts at 11 and mum often having car talks with me on the way home from school calling me fat)  My partner helps all he can but I don't want to worry him with all that's going on in my brain, even though he's the one person I've been the most honest with.   I am even considering smoking at 2pm just because I had a long and intense session of dreams (I don't usually sleep through the night but have 3 hours of sleep and awakeness) where I usually woke up completely emotionally drained and shaken from a horribly tense situation happening in dreams for 6 hours where I was unable to wake. This happens sometimes and it can cause panic attacks and for me to not want to get out of bed until late. But today I was okay but my back feels an old type of tense that it needs something to calm it down more and my coping mechanisms haven't helped.  I just Idk why I'm here My brain is constantly chattering and I smoke weed to calm it down  It doesn't make any sense and everyone has said that I need a job but I've been unable to get one I've been working as hard as I can and no one will believe me None of my friends want to talk to me anymore and none of them even want to help me fundraiser the worlds greatest shave by even giving two dollars My favourite thing is staying inside with Juna high meanjng I can enjoy the simplest things in life without worry  I just need some kind of help I've gotten into disordered eating again where I won't eat unless I'm high usually  I just feel like I'm cracking and don't know what to do even though I'm trying my best  Help?"
"I know many look back at their highschool years as less than smooth but damn mine would make a lot of people feel better about their own. My self esteem/respect was absolutely non existent and was walked over like crazy. The type of kid that didn't defend themselves at all in bullying situations. Somebody wanted chips in the cafeteria? I bought them because I was to nervous to say no and then was usually emotionally battered by said person after, but all I could do was laugh. There was actually a time in class where a girl, younger than me btw, had to stand up for me because I couldn't work up the courage to do it myself. I also went through an awkward streetwear phase which looking back made me lool even more ridiculous. After I graduated and got further away from the school and certain kids I became a lot more aware of the shit I was put through. I think this mostly has to do with going to college and being treated with a grain of respect from people that never met me. I have a level of self respect now and can and have told people off when they insult me now, But damn looking back at the person I used to be makes me angry. Almost like another form took my body over from 6-12th grade and I slowly watched as my life crumbled into an awkward mess. Should I consult a therapist about this anger? Is it normal to actually hate one's past self? I'm not suicidal about it or anything but I almost want to beat the shit out of my old self for essentially ruining the best era of my life."
"Not sure if this is the right place but I figured I would post. I hope that I get feedback.  First, I'm bipolar.   Second, okay...I will explain the best I can.  I was walking my dog today. I could hear a car behind me slowly approaching so, like always, I moved towards my right (with my dog). It was a cop car. But it was all black and no signs on the car. I know that cop cars can have faded logos but this one had no logos at all and the license plate said 'exempt'. I saw the backseat of the car (were you couldnt get to the front if you wanted to, like a fence). But I also did not see a shotgun (like there should be one). Also the 2 male passangers were both white but I cannot remember their faces. Anyway.....I was walking my dog and they veered around the corner, and when they went around the corner with my dog they were gone. And there is no way they could have just went bye-bye. Also, before they turned the corner there was a loose dog that they slowed down for and the owner (female) called for it and the dog ran towards her.  Am i going crazy? Was the cop car there? Cop cars have to show they are a cop car but this car didn't show that. Was the dog and lady real? I'm so confused. I'm coherent and in a right state of mind but I don't think the car existed. An all black cop car with no markings on it but everything else was there....can this happen? can a person literally make this up ?"
"Hi,  I am a regular person in mid-twenties, working a job, ambitious.  I've been living with anxiety, or recognized anxiety, for 6-7 years now. For a very long time, me, my friends and family believed I'm just a person who gets angry easily.  Took everyone some time to understand that my anger stems from anxiety.  In fact, a lot of my personality stems from anxiety. Over years, I've been able to channel my anxiety into being productive and felt very proud of doing the same, until I realized I was simply living with high functioning anxiety.   Well, better than low functioning, right?   I'm seen as a slightly bossy, dominating person. Most people who don't know me well enough thing I am an extremely strong person, who always has things figured out.   Well, in some things, I am. Professional things mostly. In personal life, I'm pretty far away. Quite the opposite actually.   I know some people in professional settings who think I'm too chill to get angry. Real angry. Dominating is different. I'm the chilled out dominant.   But they haven't seen me. There are only two times I've had a fit of rage in public, (kudos?) mostly misdirected, caused by my own issues, taken out on something or someone else.   I've lost people each time. Even some people I was particularly close to. They could never understand because it wasn't easy to understand. Because on the face of it, I was a strong, independent, fierce, sorted person. What I was actually was just a high functioning anxious little hypocrite who lived the opposite way of what I depicted and propagated.   After losing people, I get guilty. Guilty enough to hate myself. Guilty enough to cause myself more anxiety.  What if they hate me forever? What if I do this to everyone I love? What if I lose everyone? Does anyone really get me?  I have nightmares, seeing similar things happening. Me getting aggravated and angry, even in the dream I wanted to control myself but couldn't. I woken up crying and feeling more guilty.   I've frantically told people what happened and how guilty I was to seek their forgiveness and approval. I needed an approval to be happy, to calm down.  I write this as I was recently told my behavior is some form of PTSD. Post traumatic stress disorder, for the uninitiated. The trauma of causing a spectacle of oneself, of not being in control of yourself and of losing a friend. The stress of doing the same all over again and losing more, or all, of the people in my life.   I never thought it was PTSD, because to me, PTSD is something that affects war veterans. But apparently, a trauma is a trauma.   I write this today to probably help anyone understand their guilt and anxiety. To help a person understand a friend who is behaving weirdly.   And to see if I am the only one here. To feel better with the hope that more people like me who are living their lives. It will sound like an approval to carry on. Afterall, us anxious ones love an approval, don't we? :)"
"I'm turning 27 in about a month and within the past six months it's become blatantly obvious to me that most of my friends and coworkers have some sort of mental illness or at least a mental health problem of some kind. I don't just have one friendship group, I have a bunch of different circles of friends that are all unrelated to each other, and some who are overseas. But an alarming number of them are suffering from depression and/or anxiety, PTSD, bipolar and personality disorders, which I'm aware some would argue is not a mental illness. I think it might be something to do with the age I'm now at. It seems like my peers and I are reaching an age where things are solidified, like personality traits and bad habits and tendencies etc. I know everyone has their battles and demons and stuff, I know I certainly do and that I have my own mental health issues, but things just look really bleak from here. I'm wondering if anyone else has ever thought the same thing about their own peer groups? How did you feel about it and how did you handle it?"
This will be short. I have a cat and a dog. And I love my cat and start to cry when I think of her being gone. That said. I everytime I pick her up on have strong urges to choke her. Sometimes I put my hand around her throat just to watch her try and run away. I feel awful about it sometime but sometimes I feel that I felt better after I did it after when I do that I can act like a normal human.
"When I don't talk or get my mind occupied, I ruminate. Is there any medical term for this bad habit if it is considered disease in itself? If there is, I will do a research and see what I can do.   I ask this question because rumination exacerbates my low self-esteem, and has caused depression. A lot of people feel insecure in one way or another, but they don't get depressed because they don't think about them a lot. It happens to me to some degree as well. If I can keep talking in a casual way most of the day, I would think my disadvantage is not a big deal.   So I think I should work on rumination first. Distraction, as prescribed by psychologist, can work to some degree but cannot uproot it. Looking for something that can totally change me."
So today we had our daily safety meeting and it was about mental health. Every1 including the supervisor laughed and we didnt even cover it.... As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression this really pissed me off but i just couldnt bring myself to stand up for it =/
"Basically there is this image that I see frequently and whenever I think of or see that image I'm reminded of a bad memory because I saw that image right after the bad memory happened. I want to be able to look at that image and just see it for what it is, but that image to me feels 'tainted' now because I always associate it with that bad memory. I do have ocd how can I make myself better and not automatically remember that bad memory when I see that image?"
"Since being young i've always been kinda impulsive, but it didn't hurt people. Maybe it was because of my childhood,it was no easy because through most of it father was not at home, and parents got divorced when i was 10 and i got really hurt by this, maybe smth else, idk. But recent times (year/half ago) it has grown, im being aggresive towards my gf, for example: when we were throwing snowballs at each other i tried to throw at her with no strength at all, but ive done it with full strenght in her head. Today she was playing on my feelings, and when i blow up i throw her earmuffs at her, and pushed her with my elbow. It was not very strong, but i still did not control it. I know that I have to think before i do smth, but is there much else I can do? Can it be from smoking or being very attached to my gf, and having easily hurt feelings?"
"Hi all, I'm currently receiving treatment from my GP (UK) for depression and anxiety so I am on a course of SSRIs and I also see a counsellor on a weekly basis. This has been going on for about 2 months now. I am wondering whether I should ask for a psychiatric assessment through my GP - she said it was a bit early to be considering something like that but I am wondering whether it would help.   I have never been formally diagnosed with any mental health problems but I am fairly convinced I have borderline personality disorder and OCD. I don't know if a diagnosis could lead me onto a better treatment plan through the NHS, I may just have to carry on as I am."
"I had a girlfriend of 5 years that I loved very much. We often had issues because she was not very expressive which her, her friends, and family would admit to. She's an amazing girl she lacks communication and connection skills but maybe that's my fault? And I feel did a lot of narcissistic things without realizing. i never have been able to put my finger on if me having an issue with it is on me or her but Im realizing especially after my two quick and short relationships after that I have narcissistic tendencies. I do have a fragile ego and one thing I learned after the first was that I needed to remove my ego but once I was loved by the next girl all that went out the window and in being afraid these might not work I did have backup plans. I would say Girls do like me and in these two last relationships I found myself boasting a bit about other girls liking me (which I realize could be just me trying to reassure that I am desirable after feeling so rejected by my long relationship failing after so long).   This last girl, I realize I went at a super slow pace and didnt consider her time or feelings at all. I truly didn't mean to do this. I do like her alot. I also loved my 5 year girlfriend. And I screwed it up and I see myself not able to progress internally as long as I have this black cloud over me of hurting everything I touch without even realizing. I lack empathy and my thought is often my actions can't really hurt them And I do treat them nice but is that for my own benefit? Something I do to get love? I do want them to be happy I just don't ever feel from their perspective.  I can go on about this but I don't want this to go on. I want to maybe never date again. I don't want to hurt anyone or myself ever. I feel my intentions are good but I know NEED to change my mindset. I can't live with myself like this I hate it :l I feel like i've felt these are normal behaviors. This society praises bad men and I hate being one. I want to feel secure in a relationship. Without fear of ending up alone for committing.   Does a narcissist ever feel remorse? Is the remorse I feel real? I often think I'd be better off dead but then part of me feels I can be the best lover and am super curious about success and a happy life of helping others. Would a narcissist feel extremely bad after realizing he is one? I feel terrible and I want the people I care about to know I love them.  (Sidenote - The first I can remember narcissistic behavior was When I was 11, and with the terrorism going on in my country (USA) I had trouble understanding got a lot of anxiety, became distant and lost all my hair. I was bullied and depressed because I was a completely bald 5th grader. The only thing that saved me was standing up for myself and being a huge rebel and being SUPER confident/ cocky about myself. I found that I still became popular and attracted the girls in my class even with this condition and that made me feel normal.)"
"Hello,   I'm sorry for not putting this somewhere more specific but I don't know if there is already a DSM diagnosis for this.  Essentially when I'm really upset or stressed I can essentially just stop feeling. Like a switch I flip mentally, no more anger, the stressor is still there but it doesn't matter. If I was feeling sad then that's done too. The typical downside is that it seems to be an all or nothing thing until I come out of it. I won't feel happy or excited for about a day either. I've tried to be happy again but it just doesn't come. The switch analogy falls here because I can't seem to turn it on. For most of my life I'd say my (socially) positive emotions have been on the weak side while my negative ones are strong. That is to say I'm quick to anger and slow to joy.    I'm not sure if this is normal or not. I've had a few sessions with a therapist, but the first couple were getting to know each other and we didn't get to this before my insurance stopped covering them.  I'm not expecting professional advice, just an ear (or an eye I suppose). It is hard to admit these things to people close to me, so anonymity on the internet it is. Thanks for taking the time to read this, even just putting words to it is a relief."
"Hello everyone. Been lurking around reddit for quite a while now, didn't post much on this site. I have a lot of questions about myself and my mental health. I know that it is not the right place to ask these kind of questions and I probably should visit a psychologist or anything related to that to get answers but as far as i've tried, none of the specialists have the answers or a clue for what has been happening to me. Now to the point. I tend to play too many mind games with other people. I meet a person and then try to get to know him/her better, so I can set myself an idea what to do with him or her. I tend to lean people over to my side, I've taken people out of their groups, get some kind of an advantage from it, i can get any answer i want or make my way around easily for whatever i'd like to hear. Every person for me is a challenge. As far as i've noticed, i'm most vicious at night. I tend to hurt people even if i don't particularly mean it. I can't stop playing these games at night. I've tried to do sports to get myself a bit busier but nothing seems to be working. It doesn't matter if i'm tired or not at evenings/nights. My inner-demon comes out. My significant other finds it hard to forecast my actions and behavior. I'm worried. Sleep schedule seems pretty okay. I've got great people surrounding me but i have no idea how long will it last for.   Help me."
"I understand what a pathological liar is and believe I am one, I lie about things as minor as what I had for breakfast this morning and I also lie about major things like mental state + finances.  It's put a real strain on my relationship and my SO (bless her) has survived for a year now but is pretty much on the edge of breaking up with me about it.  Would there be any other underlying reason behind it as to why I do it? I've tried to stop myself 1000s of times but i honestly feel like I can't help it."
"We have always been very close and communicated well. But lately she has stopped talking to me. Not sulking- she just seems to find it hard. She also has withdrawn from me physically, which is very difficult too.  I would like to support her through it but I don't really know what helps and what just makes her feel worse. I'd really like to hear first hand experience from anyone else who has suffered with depression as to what helped them."
"Hi. I've been recently to the doctor, and he gave me the following pills, even after i told him i did not want to take any. Alprazolan, Depakote ER, Quetros and Valdoxan. He said I take the last three just before bed, but, every night after I take them, i feel like i'm dying. My limbs slowly stop functioning properly, its like my legs and arms become numb, and then I dont fall asleep like i used to before i began taking meds. I just pass out. This us making me feel really, really bad, and the fact that its a lot of pills for many different illnesses makes me feel worse ( anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia ) . I feel like a malfunctioning product. I dont know what to do."

"Hi,  First time on here.. so here goes...  When I was a child I would black / block out things, it's super strange and it only bothered me today after watching Split (it's ok) at the pictures, after the movie I started thinking about when I was a little, these strange things would happen and I only remember about three of them, the first one I am about seven years old I am waiting in line with my family to get on the train to take us to Alton towers entrance and all of a sudden my mum is shouting at me and my dad goes say sorry to your grandad! I remember being totally shocked and asking what have I done?? So that made my parents even more angry and then i started to cry asking again what have I done then I find out I had sed in a nasty tone shut up! When grandad was talking to my baby sister... Second time is just like the first, I was at school and a helper starts telling me off saying  I should never talk to someone like that! Again same story I ask what I have done I had sed shut up to her, but I told her I don't remember, the last one is just strange I was on camping trip with school year 5 and I found my self before sitting down and then in then I was in the middle Arch field and as like before being shouted out by teachers and staff, again telling them I don't know how I got there, worse part was the teacher grabbed my neck!.. by the way this was 2003...  Its just today that I have actually joined them together.. thinking shit that's like that time and that one and that...  It all stoped after I was 11 or I just don't remember it... I do suffer with depression, could it have been an early sign?? Am I just crazy? and everyone has them... Before someone says we're you abused?.... no I wasn't... I had good parents and the people who would babysit me are both sides of grandparents...  I just needed to write it down it's been bugging me for hours..."
"Hi reddit, first time post here seeking some input from this community. I am a 24 y/o male with PTSD, OCD, Anxiety, and severe depression. As of lately I've been having multiple mental breakdowns, I'm always angry, and my appetite is no where to be found. Is it time to seek a professional? If so, what are some steps for socially awkward adult get the needed help."
"I've opened up a bit. Shared some of what I went through in Vegas and the fact I'm in withdrawal from antipyschotics with my fiancÃ©e. He said he now understood the episode of rage and violence and that it most likely would not occur again. He has finally understood with the data to back it up why I wished to go off daily antipyschotics and use it as an episodic medication only. He is being and said he will remain supportive and try to help as my brain readjusts to life without medications and returns to a homeostasis point. I had ECT today where my doctor discussed my very sharp decline and started to discuss hospitalization. I had to explain what has happened and have not fully disclosed, but for the first time put to words the phrase sexual assault. That was unimaginably hard, thank God right after the anesthesiologist gave me my ketamine dose. It was agreed that I can forego going inpatient, but I have to return for the time being to weekly ECT treatments, and I just got them to every 6 weeks after a year. Sigh! But with coping techniques and meditation I'm in a much better state. I'm leaving for Hawaii on Monday, yay, and returning on Sunday and will have ECT the following Monday. I have work to do and things to look forward too. I have also set some short term goals and and working on some longer term ones. I feel hopeful even with the trauma and withdrawals, which are fucking terrible. I'm down to 121 from 128 on the 22. Hopefully they will lessen soon and I'm also hoping in not going through rebound mania. I'm going to stay positive and hopeful that I just may have found an avenue, small though it is, to a better healthier me and if not then we will deal with it. Thanks to those who were there during one of my darkest times and to anyone who will be in the future. Be healthy and forgive oneself. Much live."
"Hello! You can just call me M.  I am 19 years old. For as long as I can recall, I have had concerns that I have a mental illness. It feels very real to me. I don't want to misdiagnose myself, or even attempt a home diagnosis, and I really don't want to come across as pretentious by thinking I could be mentally ill. I have struggled with depression, anxiety and suicide since as far as I can remember, and it got worse around the mark of 4th-5th grade. I never got along well with other kids, I have difficulty keeping eye contact or talking to my peers. I am at least 3 years behind people my age, as I cannot drive, have never had sex, no prom, never go out with friends, etc. I have had concerns that I could have Asperger's syndrome, and it is a concern my mother had had ever since I was very little but my father wouldn't let her look into it. He sees my depression and anxiety and odd behaviors as an act of defiance against him, and that I hate him so much I want to make him my bitch and it's a power play to watch him struggle in public over how to deal with me and my mental issues. This is very very gross and untrue. I love my father very much and do not feel this way at all. My odd behaviors in public have nothing to do with him, they come from my brain. I feel very broken, all the time. I'm confused, upset, angry. I self harm, I ignore myself, deny myself happiness because I am broken, and I feel like I don't deserve to be happy. My mother wanted to get me evaluated but she passed away suddenly and recently and she was one of the only supportive people I ever had. My older sister is very concerned and supportive and she wants to take me, upon my request and concern and me being fed up with having lived in fear and the unknown for so darn long, she wants to take me to see a mental health doctor and see if I really do need to be diagnosed with a mental illness. Something feels terribly wrong with me; I know I'm somehow different than normally functioning people. I can list my concerns if needed, like what stands out to me that I feel points to a mental illness living in my brain. Ok, sorry for getting long winded but here is where I really need help. I do not know where to go from here. How do you get a diagnosis? What are the steps? What kind of doctor do I really need to see and how do I do it? I need to know how to see a doctor who can help me. My sister is willing to take me this coming Wednesday so I need to figure out soon. I really want closure and I need help in order to do so.  Thank-you so much for your time."

"I'm sure my story is the same as every body else's, but uh. As a young child my family ran into a lot of problems revolving my brothers mental health, he abused drugs stole more money than we can count and wound up being diagnosed with brain tumors, anerexia and other problems such as that.  And one morning when I was about to drive to foot ball practice with my dad*this was about 11 years since he was first diagnosed* I woke up to find him overdosed on heroine and surrounded in forloco bottles. I didn't know what to do so I picked him up and ran him to my nearest neighbor. (He weighed about 90+ pounds at the time due to the anorexia )  And it kinda fucked life up after that.  Recently I've been having an over protective state of mind and i cant stop my self from fighting and i cant get the sight of my brother on his death bed out of my mind this feeling has been bothering me for almost a year now. It gets to the point that if I'm not breaking some ones bones I break my own. (Fingers and knuckles ) is this a common thing for people who've gone through trauma like that?"
"I'm so sorry this is long, but it's really the short version of a mixture of personal experiences, self projection, philosophy, emotional breakdowns, and suicidal thoughts. But I really think it's something that a lot of people would and should be interested in, so I encourage you to read it. Initially, I had no idea where to post this because it involves all walks of life. I decided to post it here because people interested in mental health might be the most willing to share an opinion.   My question is fairly simple; is pursuing self improvement worth it? Really what I mean by that is, is it possible? And even if it is possible, is my short life better spent enjoying myself rather than chasing after dreams?   I'm 19 years old, and I've been interested in this for 5 years now. I'll share a brief version of my story, because I seem to be alone in this obsession that I have. It started out with me watching Eric Thomas' motivational [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vuetQSwFW8) that went viral when I was 14. His speech made me feel like I wasn't doing anything with my life. I started to put effort into school and other hobbies. By the time I was 18, I was a black belt, an eagle scout, and I had a certification from a trade school, besides graduating and getting accepted into college. I guess those were the things that were important to me at the time. I really believed that I could learn to do just about anything if I set my mind to it, and put in effort. I even followed people on YouTube like Tai Lopez, who I now consider to be a scam.   The summer after graduating high school, I started working for a fabrication company, and everything I thought I knew about the world turned upside down. I learned more about myself in 3 months at that job, than I had in 4 years of high school. I was considered, and still am considered the shop idiot. The way I've been treated there is essentially equated to bullying. My intelligence declined. I don't know what it is, but there seems to be a huge difference in being in a classroom and being in a workplace. This ruined me, because I believed I was smarter than I really am, which made me feel even dumber. I was a top student in my physics class, but I can't think through anything in that shop. I can think of many reasons why this might be the case (the noise, the general depressing and unsafe environment), but they just seem like petty excuses, and I won't go into them. Anyways, I never did attend that college I was accepted to because the guys at the shop had given me a deep rooted belief that I am mentally incompetent. It's January now, and I'm still living with my parents. I haven't spent much of what I've earned at that job, and I don't plan on attending school. I've also quit martial arts and working out all together. What's the point of putting in mindless effort?   What I'm getting at is this. I have a deep relationship with the idea of overcoming obstacles, pushing through pain, never giving up, and relentlessly fighting to get where I want to be. But at this point in my life, I feel like [Danger Barch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eo0WZT22sU) from Million Dollar Baby. I'm a retard and a joke. I'm a degenerate, with lofty dreams. I want to be something better, but it is simply physically, genetically, and socially impossible.   Right now, I'm standing on the peak of a mountain, one side facing my success; intelligence, money, friends, influence, competence and respect. The other side facing what appears to be reality; simplicity, debt, loneliness, isolation, incompetence, and people giving me that disingenuous smile that you give a child or a dog when they do something cute like shit their pants.  When I think about the last option, I picture myself raising a gun to my head.   I've been reading everything I can bout the idea of self improvement. I've read books similar to Improvement of the mind by Isaac Watts. I've researched self determination theory. I've tried every form of brain training. And so far, this is what I believe; If you're paying someone money to train your brain, it's obviously a scam. But, that doesn't mean that other things will work either.   When I talk about this with people, I find people on different sides of the fence; the all self help is a scam group, and the you can do anything you set your mind to group. I don't believe either of these statements are completely true. The truth is always going to be nuanced and complicated. The truth rejects simplicity. I'm a scientist at heart (which sounds pathetic coming from a retard, but even a retard can ask why things fall to the ground) and I've found truth coming from both of these parties. Obviously, brain training programs like Lumosity are just trying to get your money. But many of these self help gurus advocate things like detailed planning and self control, and I find nothing wrong with that.   So here's my conclusion, and I'll leave you with this. I want to find the truth. Where can I find it? Who else is asking if body's and minds are static or dynamic, and who should I be having conversations with? Should I give up on self help simply because some people make millions selling pseudoscience? I don't need motivation to do anything anymore. I know how to motivate myself. If I want something, I'll commit my mind and body to it, and forget all other distractions. I have the willpower to to spend days wide awake, pushing myself through any kind of pain. Retarded or not, in terms of determination I would put most men to shame. But if I don't think something is worth fighting for, I'm not even going to try. If I find out that there is no hope for me and that I'm locked inside my genetically inferior brain whether I put in effort or not, I will never leave my bed, and I will welcome a life of junk food, porn and Netflix. I know this is a weird, and possibly heavy thing for me to ask people to respond to, but there you go. That's my current verdict on how my life is going I guess. I'm feeling like it's do or die scenario for me right now. And lately, I've felt like dying."
"I just had the most shocking realization (it may be wrong); I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression.  I was interested in my current mental status all the sudden and I thought to myself out of the blue; when do I write the most? And I checked when I post my stories online. Only in late February- early September. Those are also the times where I am most positive and enjoy life the most.  Now I have two things I think it could be and I want your opinions people of Reddit.  A) Seasonal Affective Disorder. B) Bipolar disorder. Or you know a winning combo of the two.  It could be SAD because I live in Michigan and warm months are from April- September. But that wouldn't account for me writing in February and March when I haven't seen the sun for 2 months. And wouldn't account for no writing in July- September.  It could be Bipolar disorder because my sister had it (and committed suicide due to it), my grandmother had it, and my great grandmother had it. I think that in the months of February-September I am in a manic phase. And then in October-January I am in a depressive phase.   But I'm not sure.  It also worthy to note that;  A) The only treatment and help I have ever gotten are in the transition from September to October. B) I got antidepressants in March which is when I switch from depressive to manic. C) My grade have constantly gone from C and B to B and A  D) when I write in Manic mode I write 4000 words in 3 hours. E) When in depressive I write a out 40 words in 3 days.  I think to further prove my point I am going to create a graph by documenting my mood on a scale of 1-100 every day for a year starting today.  Please give some of your opinions. ;-;"
"Of everything really. I'm a twenty two year old woman. I have depression, borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, anxiety and social anxiety, Asperger's syndrome, OCD, PTSD and ADHD. All diagnosed by several different psychiatrists. I was physically and emotionally abused by my older brother for years when I was a kid. I am heavily medicated to control my problems. It is not well controlled. Every three months I enter a new low. I'll spend a month or more depressed and miserable. I'll usually end up suicidal or cutting myself, and then end up in my local psych ward, where I have spent more time in than out in the past four years. I made it through all of last year without a suicide attempt or hospitalization. I did cut myself when my grandparents both suddenly died, but no one knows about that. My psych nurse always tells me when I'm in these lows to keep fighting because it'll pass. I know it'll pass. That's not the problem. The problem is in three months I'll be right back here again. What's the point of living if I can only be happy in three month intervals? It's been this way for four long, painful years. And that's not counting the years from 13-18 when the depressions lasted for months at a time. At least then I was only In the hospital once a year. I know I have things to live for. A newborn nephew, another on the way, and an almost 7 year old niece who idolizes me and would be devastated if I were to die. But what about me? I live so my family can be happy while I'm miserable. My mom tells me suicide is a selfish act. But is it really? Isn't it more selfish to ask me to keep living in misery and constant emotional agony just so she can be happy? I just want a moments peace. Not this false hope that the medication gives me. And I wish I could get off this damn medication. There's the side effects, like the weight gain that crushes my self-esteem. I was 90 lbs before I started in antidepressants. Now I'm 250. Admittedly I was never pretty but at least I looked good in a bikini. Now I can't even we're a one piece swimsuit without people staring at my stretch marks and flab. Plus the medication kills my creativity. What good is being an artist when you can't think of anything to draw or paint? And then when I do get struck by creativity I can't do anything because I'm to miserable to put the effort into getting all my art supplies out and doing something. Everyone says I'm lazy. I'm not lazy! Do they not realize how much effort it is just to get out of bed when your struggling with depression? I hate my life. I hate the way society views my life. I feel worthless. I'm a lost cause. Why bother trying anymore? Even my psychiatrist says she doesn't know how to treat me anymore. I just want to die."
"I've always had the urge to be extremely skinny on levels of just skin and bones, but I never liked starving myself or puking out things I ate. I wouldn't say I have an eating disorder so I'm not sure how to label this? I don't think it's exactly sane to have these urges. I suffer from clinical depression, could it be some sort of a side effect?"
"i even dont know what im feeling. i just cannot describe it. its somewhat kind of mixed feeling, like anger, disgust, anxiety and worry. i just feel empty. lately, i have harmed myself because i think i just deserve it. i feel like im a bad person. once, ive been in a psychiatric hospital because i tried to kill myself 7 times. and so, i tried to kill myself because of how i felt. they couldnt diagnose me propely, though. First, i heard i had depression, then, they said i have some kind of an anxiety disorder and now they told me i have bipolar disorder. they suggested that its hard to diagnose since im young, and i feel exhausted. i dont feel like anything is going to help me. i always felt like i was useless, disgusting and that i didnt deserve anything at all. i was bullied in my primary school and i was mentally abused by my dad, which made me quieter than before. im scared of people, by how they look at me, and im scared they might talk something about me behind my back. they look at me like im an total idiot. my only friend shouts at me because i cant open up to people, its just so hard. and even if i talk with someone, i cant speak propely. i just want to be normal and accepted the way i am. i feel like its always going to be this way. im scared of being alone. i dont want to feel like this way anymore. i just want to get rid of myself. i feel like a burden to others, and i think they would live better without me. i want to feel better, and not think about suicide all the time."
"Hi everyone. I'm going through an incredibly severe depression, and have started on a new medication and with a new doctor. I'm single, and I live alone. I have no support system. I have been largely abandoned.  I was thinking today about all my friends who have gotten married and had babies and bought houses. I alway marvel at how people rally around each other for happy milestones, and lend moral support and practical help and even monetary help. People sacrifice to help out when others are at their happiest.  But when someone has debilitating depression, people seem to jump ship. There isn't the same support. People don't show up, even when you beg for help. I mean, people rally around each other even when they're enduring the death of a loved one, but depression? No one wants to know you.  I have my theories as to why this is, but wondered what this community thinks of that phenomenon, and if it's ever happened to you.  I could really use the help and attention that a new bride or mother would be getting right around now. But instead I'm going it alone and struggling greatly.  Thanks, everyone :)"
"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 year old F. Anyways, all my life I've felt different than those around me. Like I'm disconnected, or all my emotions are very, very shallow. I've been seeing a therapist for my feelings of emptiness and so far it hasn't helped. I've never even had a crush. I've gone out with plenty of guys (and girls), and I like the sex and the dates, but not them. Most of the time I end up feeling like I'm not a real person, my therapist says it's most likely BPD.   So, my question: When I was very young (around 2/3), I got free of my car seat and fell a few feet onto my face. It was bloody and there were stitches, but that's all I've been told. I am in a psych class and we are talking about brain structure, and apparently the frontal lobe deals with emotion... is it possible I may have some minor brain damage that is stopping me from feeling things?   Thanks!"
"Hi everyone. I'm in a really bad place right now and don't know who to talk to. I figured it would be easy to get different feedback here or advice in regards to my sister being a psychopath.   First; I'd just like to give some backstory. My sister is older but acts like a teenager in college. My family supports her but know she is psycho. When she was a teenager she was really bad, got arrested, shoplifted, had many fights and short relationships. She's a great liar and manipulator and has ruined many relationships within the family and her own friends by doing so. She lacks empathy, remorse, guilt, and any time anyone attempts to put her in place she wages war and has a MASSIVE fit. She also labels her victims as pitiful, weak, babies, overly emotional, and too sensitive when she in fact is the cause of so much stress and pain.   She manipulates my life, lies about my relationships, and makes up entire stories to get me in trouble (I'm in my 20s still). I can't just pretend I don't have a sister, but I cannot live in fear of her terrorizing me anymore. My parents are scared of her and have to give her way and take her side to keep her happy. And I can't talk to anyone.  When she was younger my mom took her to a psychiatrist but she outplayed the psychiatrist. That's how manipulative she is.  It's a lot more than just this going on, but I thought I'd just give the bare minimum and see if anyone else is going though the same thing- a psychopath family member who is terrorizing you or someone you know. And, how do I deal with this? How do I stop living in fear?"
"About a month ago I started taking Prozac for General Anxiety/Panic disorder. I recently stopped taking it because it was causing suicidal thoughts, I felt numb, and constantly had a upset stomach. Now since I have stopped taking the medication I have had a terrible migraine, dizziness, nausea, and nightmares.   Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms, any tips on how to lessen the effects?"
"But I quit going to Therapy last time because I was getting no help at all for what I needed help with. And I feel I need it more than ever now, I didn't understand the consequences of not going, and it made me do some things I'm not proud of doing. I don't know what to do, because I can only walk everywhere, I can't take any method of transportation. Unless someone drives me."
"So in 2015 I was put on Fleouxetine for my OCD. I considered posting this in r/OCD but since it's an antidepressant it could probably apply to a number of mental illnesses. Anyway, fast forward two years later and to put it simply, it's worked way too well. I no longer care very much about anything OCD related (no more intrusive thoughts, no more anxiety) but I also don't care about anything else.  I have no drives, no goals, no passions. I've become an arsehole with no empathy. I'm apathetic towards everything and everyone. I'm so far removed from who I used to be that I honestly think I'd rather go back to the worst stages of my OCD rather than be like this. I can't be bothered to help myself. I'm bored but can't be arsed to do anything. I can't get over myself. I can't even talk properly. All my words feel wrong.  About a month ago I stopped taking my medication of my own accord. So I suppose my question is this: Will I ever go back to normal and how long will it take? 2 years of altered brain chemistry is a long time and right now I just feel empty. I'm not sad or happy, I'm just a straight fucking line.   What do I do? Thanks."
"Iâ€™ve been living with Depersonalization (DP) for over 3 years now. If you know about this condition youâ€™ll know that smoking weed is a common trigger in most people that suffer from DP. Thatâ€™s not what triggered mine though. I've never smoked weed in my life. Mine was triggered via an existential crisis. For months I obsessed over the nature of reality, trying to understand it, and prove that my perception of it was the correct one. With no exaggeration my brain was in overdrive every second of every day for MONTHS, until I finally blew a fuse in my brain I guess.   After months of incessant obsessive thinking about reality and trying to prove thereâ€™s no way we could be in the matrix or a brain-in-a-vat controlled by aliens or what have you, I decided to myself to just STOP. I was just exhausted of THINKING. But it was too late by then. The moment I â€œgave upâ€ and decided to believe what I felt was the most convincing and evidence-backed perspective on reality and just go with it, I immediately, and for no apparent reason began to philosophically analyse HUMOR. I guess at the time something funny happened and then I just began analysing humor and trying to create a theory for it. This was not something I chose nor could I help it. From that point onwards anything at all that had to do with humor triggered my obsessive thinking. If my brother made a joke.. if I read something funny or tried watching a sitcom.. my main issue here wasnâ€™t merely the obsessive thinking.. itâ€™s that the thinking was fear-driven. Because I hadnâ€™t come up with a satisfactory theory for humor yet, I felt like I didnâ€™t UNDERSTAND humor anymore.. I felt like I FORGOT what â€œfunnyâ€ even is.. and that left me feeling terrified. I felt like I was losing my mind. I felt like I was losing a very important part of what made life worth living. Humor and laughter.  So to give an example of a chain reaction of what would happen:  **Goin about my day, all is well ïƒ Suddenly my sister would say a joke or do something funny, and those around us would laughïƒ I too get the impulse to laugh but I immediately hold back and helplessly begin frantically analysing what had just been said/what happened and why it was funny. For instance if a pun was said I would ask myself, â€œwhy is that funny. Ok the 2 words sound the same but WHY is THAT funnyâ€¦etc.â€ïƒ The second these thoughts begin, I am removed from the moment.. I am left feeling anxious and empty inside, while others laughed and enjoyed the moment.**  This sort of thing went on for months. Everything around me triggered me. A 20 minute sitcom would take me over an hour because Iâ€™d keep pausing and analysing all the funny bits and â€œtrying to make sense of themâ€. It was torture. And once I was triggered Iâ€™d obsess for days at a time without a minuteâ€™s rest, barring sleep. Finally after months of resisting laughter, and persistent numbness, fear, and obsession, I managed to build a theory to explain humor. Coincidentally I found out that the theory I came up with already existed! It is called the â€œBenign Violation Theoryâ€. It was a relief to know that the theory existed. It validated my own thinking. And made me feel less crazy for thinking about this stuff and in the way I did. Finally I SOLVED it I thought.. I know what FUNNY is again!! .. Iâ€™m normal again!!.. the cycle finally ENDS.. now I could just LIVE.. but no.. my mind IMMEDIATELY started to obsess about a different element of reality. And the cycle restarted. Iâ€™d continue to be triggered and then obsess until I solved the WHY of the new object of my obsession and then my mind would jump to the next thing. The things my mind would obsess over were primarily anything that had to do with human EMOTIONS.. and the manifestation of these emotions.. human reactions and interactions.. all at the most basic of levels. Iâ€™d philosophically analyse handshakes and hi-fives and kissing and hugging and the way we greet each other and dancing and singing and someone banging on their chest when theyâ€™ve scored a goal, and you name it..! Keep in mind, these thoughts were intrusive and fear-driven. This was not something I enjoyed doing. Itâ€™s something that Iâ€™ve felt like I have to do.  This has been going on for the last 3+ years. Iâ€™ve had no support during this time. Iâ€™ve lost a lucrative job because of it. Iâ€™ve lost relationships because of it and soured those I still maintain. Iâ€™ve lost countless moments Iâ€™ll never get back.. countless opportunities.. For the 1st 6-9 months, Iâ€™d try to seclude myself as much as possible. Having a conversation with someone or being around people was too much stimulation. Everything would send my brain into overdrive. Everything around me triggered me. Heck even being locked up in my room and trying to read through my facebook feed was torture. The only good thing was at least when I had â€œsolved somethingâ€ I didnâ€™t worry about it anymore for the most part. For instance, at this moment in time, for the most part, I can laugh again.   Nowadays thankfully Iâ€™m a lot better than when this all started. Iâ€™ve come a long way. Iâ€™ve realized that the key to getting over this once and for all is to try to let go and to not allow fear to control me. To not entertain the thoughts that come nor the urge to analyse. But itâ€™s so much easier said than done. The thoughts are so tenacious. And I absolutely canâ€™t help being triggered. And the problem is once Iâ€™m triggered Iâ€™m immediately removed from the moment, even if I choose to not engage in any analysis beyond that.   I want to give specific examples again of my thought processes to really let you in on what I deal with on a day to day basis. For example, if Iâ€™m dancing and I realize that Iâ€™m dancing, Iâ€™d panic and start thinking hmm wait, why am I dancing.. why do humans dance.. is to express? Ok to express what exactly.. and why do we need to express.. is it just for validation? Or is it for the relief that accompanies expression.. or is it both..?? And are those 2 things separate or connected.. and so on and so forth.. if for example I got the urge to be silly with my workmates Iâ€™d stop myself and start thinking, why do I have the urge to be silly.. is it to be funny and make them laugh? Is it because being silly is fun in that â€œbeing dumbâ€ relieves some stress/tension? These are 2 distinct reasons.. so which one is it! Why am I getting the impulse to be silly! (You can see how being triggered and obsessing is robbing me of the moment) If I wanted to kiss my girlfriend all over her body Iâ€™d start thinking, why do I want to kiss her all over.. what I am doing exactly when I kiss her.. what am I trying to achieve?.. Is it simply a means for proximity? Am I doing so for my pleasure or hers? Am I doing so to selfishly and metaphorically taste and own her body? Or am I selflessly expressing my love and adoration? Well, what is LOVE? Is it giving or is it taking? If I kissed her all over am I giving or am I taking? And what is it that I am giving and what is it that I am taking? I wouldnâ€™t be satisfied just saying â€œitâ€™s both giving and takingâ€ because a)kissing and b) being kissed are 2 distinct experiences. Etc. etc. etc. you get the picture now I hope.  And all of it is so exhausting. And so distracting. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so worried about the future. How am I going to continue living like this. How can I be a husband or a father or a successful person like this. I just want to be normal. I just want to enjoy my life. I donâ€™t want to be triggered anymore. I just want to dance. And joke. And laugh. And love. I just want to kiss my girl all over and not have to think about it.   I just want to Live. :â€™("
"hi, this is my first time posting on reddit so i'm sorry if i do something wrong. and i apologize if some of the ages and years don't add up, my sense of time and my memory are atrocious. mentions of suicide and self harm ahead.  i am a 20 year old female and a sophomore in college. i have clinical depression and have (mostly) recovered from social anxiety and ocd. i'm writing this because for the past couple of years, i'm noticing myself behaving in ways that i haven't before.  let me preface this by saying i have had a wonderful life in terms of upbringing. my parents have loved me unconditionally and provided me with everything i've needed. i have no trauma or life-changing experiences to think of, so i really have no reason to feel or act this way.  i'll start with the basic skeleton of my experiences. i have been depressed since i was 13. no one seemed to care until i was 17, when my parents decided to read my diary in which i had written of my thoughts of suicide. i was taken to the hospital, but i talked my way out of staying; i was fuming at my parents and the whole ordeal was extremely embarrassing for me. i was then forced to attend therapy with a woman that i liked as a person, but who was entirely unhelpful (i had seen a therapist prior to this when i was 13 or 14 for social anxiety, who also did nothing for me). shortly after i was put on celexa and stayed on it for a year and a half. it kind of worked near the beginning, but after being put on the maximum dose with no improvement i was weaned off in may 2016 when i was 19. that summer, with no meds and no therapy, was...rough, to say the least. i started cutting, which was new for me, and i've been hooked ever since. in november i was put on wellbutrin, which has been much more helpful in terms of the depressive symptoms. i also went to the campus counseling center a few times before one appointment during which the counselor judged me for behavior i can't help, so i stopped going. i'm still taking the meds though; some days i feel like it's the greatest thing ever but others i feel like i'm just taking sugar pills.  now for these years i had your run of the mill depressive symptoms, hopelessness, anhedonia, oversleeping, irritability, etc etc you know. i'm honestly not sure when i started to change, if i had to guess it would be about halfway through my freshman year of college. i started hating. hating things and people so intensely. i hated the way people looked and talked and behaved. i said horrible things about people behind their back to my boyfriend. i was unreasonably angry all the time and everything set me off. i had terrible mood swings. i couldn't stop spending money. i fought one-sided fights with my boyfriend about every week. i felt like total shit and the celexa wasn't doing its job. suicide was very appealing, but my family was going through some shit (my mom is kind of a mess) and doing anything like that made me feel guilty and selfish, so i held it all in like i always have to.  present day (still on wellbutrin), i'm still falling apart. i cut about every other day. technically i'm an alcoholic. i still have the anger and mood swings and hatred and all that good stuff. only now i'm kind of losing a sense of who i am. any time i'm asked to tell someone about myself, i can give them facts (20, female, student, sagittarius, etc.) but that's about it. i have no idea who i am or what my beliefs really are. i feel like an entirely different person every day. and these past couple of weeks, some days, reality doesn't feel...real. ik a lot of people get that thing where /they/ don't feel real, but i don't hear much about the world not feeling real.  relationships are becoming increasingly difficult. my boyfriend (T) is still with me for some reason (14 months yesterday actually) even though i treat him like shit. i'm mean to him, i guilt him into doing things for me, i intentionally do things that i know upset him, and so on. we're rarely intimate because i'm ashamed of my cuts, so he's really not getting much of anything out of being with me. i am notoriously bad at keeping friends because in my eyes, if you slip up then you're dead to me. i don't want anything to do with you, and i don't really forgive people. so because of that i've cut a lot of people out of my life. alternatively if i start to really like you then i get obsessed with you, but i also hold you at a high standard because i like you so much, so if you fuck up i'll be extremely upset and hate you for a while, but eventually i'll probably come around.  (this portion is LONG but essential)  ...okay, i'm speaking of one person in particular. i made a friend (K) in 11th grade that i developed a crush on. K didn't seem to like me back and my confidence was extremely low (never had a relationship or been kissed, boys never even glanced at me), so spending time with him was great but painful. we remained friends and about a month into my freshman year of college K texted me saying that he didn't like me, he loved me, and had for a while. i. was. elated. i couldn't believe it, but i also didn't know what to do. i was entirely inexperienced and i was afraid that he wouldn't like me anymore if we started dating. i told K i still liked him too but that i wasn't ready for my first relationship to be long distance (i go to school 500 miles away), which he said was fine and that we could work something out when i got back.  about 2 weeks later i started dating my current boyfriend, T. honestly i felt forced into it and i don't want to talk about why. it's nothing terrible, i just wish it went differently. anyway i had to break the news to K and he said something along the lines of that it was fine and not to worry about it. for the first couple of months i was happy with T but it faded as the months went on. summer 2016, a week before move in week, K texted me and told me he got a girlfriend. i lost my absolute shit. i was shaky, crying, a total mess. a few hours later i texted K and told him that i was thinking about breaking up with T to let him know that i was unsure about this relationship, and kind of to guilt trip him (i actually was seriously considering it though). during these texts i mentioned that i still liked him (K) and that i didn't know what to do. he wasn't helpful in terms of advice but all i wanted was his attention.  so i finally get back to school and see T (he lives 2 hours from campus and i didn't see him in person over break) and the honeymoon period restarted for all of a week, then i was back to being meh over T and obsessed with K. honestly i didn't want to talk to K because the mere thought of someone else having him drove me up a wall, but eventually his girlfriend dumped him and he came crawling back to me for emotional support. terrible, but i was ecstatic. mid semester break rolled around and i went home, only getting to see K once. prior to this he had texted me really sweet things like calling me beautiful, calling me love, etc. but after i got back to school it suddenly stopped and started addressing me as a normal friend. this broke me. i was convinced he hated me and thought i was ugly and only talked to me because he pitied me (he knows i don't have friends).  over christmas break i only saw K a couple of times, but in those few hours we spent together i've never been happier. one night after driving home from coffee with him, he texted me saying that he loves me more and more each time he sees me, and the beautifuls and loves started up again. i could've cried from happiness. i said i felt the same way, because i do. i love him so much. and all throughout the break i found myself not missing T.  ...only K forgot my birthday. he thought it was a day later than it is. i didn't speak to him or accept his apologies for days. i hated him. HATED him. i cut over it. i figured he wouldn't even care if i died. eventually though i did relent and begrudgingly accepted his apologies, and i'm mostly over it.  why don't i just break up with T and date K, you ask? i do still love T, and i'm just...comfortable in this relationship. T really, really loves me and accepts every part of me. he's never once gotten angry with me or raised his voice to me. i love K but he's completely different (getting him to apologize for something is like herding cats) and i'm afraid my darker side will come out and i'll ruin things to the point where we can't even be friends. if i lose K i won't want to live anymore. and as horrible as it is to say, T is much easier to manipulate so i have constant control.  presently, my heart skips a beat whenever i get a text, and pretty much stops beating when i see that K texted me. i really enjoy talking to him but whenever he says guess what or can i ask you something or something along those lines i get extremely nervous and if i'm eating i lose my appetite, because i'm mortified that the next thing he says will be i got a girlfriend.  K isn't the first person i've been enamored with. i've been obsessed with plenty of people in my years, some of them complete strangers who i met online, and it was always the same thing: i fall for you, you mention having a girlfriend, i lose my shit, i'm done with you, i move on to the next person. it's just unfortunate that i've never felt this way about T.  yes, for some reason, despite being in a relationship myself, i am extremely volatile to people who have significant others. it's like i'm jealous. not of either of the people, but jealous of the fact that they're in a relationship. it's almost like i want everyone to be lonely and miserable.  i can't seem to make friends anymore because if you fuck up, i'm done with you. if i fuck up, i assume you hate me and i'll bend over backwards to get you to like me. everyone. must. like. me. i could despise someone but i'll still be nice to them because they MUST like me. i love attention and praise and i'll take it from anyone.  - end huge relationship part -  speaking of praise, that's one thing, but criticism? i shut down. i take it as a personal attack. i avoid opening emails and feedback from professors because any criticism will be a direct insult to me as a person. i don't post on forums because i'm afraid someone will disagree with me or find something wrong with my post and point it out, which is of course, a personal attack. even with this post i feel awkward and annoying with how long it's getting (hope you don't hate me).  i have bad thinking habits too. everything either is or isn't, it's black or white. right or wrong. love or hate. agree or disagree with every word that comes out of your mouth. it makes me close minded.  so all these problems are relatively new and seem to be becoming more intrusive. i'm trying to live a normal life but it's hard with so much going on in my head. summers are historically very difficult for me so i wouldn't be surprised if i finally broke down and attempted suicide during summer break, and that's scary; i've come close a couple times this semester. i kind of feel like the meds are working but they're uncovering other underlying issues. i've had 7 therapists and none of them have helped me, so i'm kind of fed up with seeking help. i don't really know what's going on and it's frightening.  even with all these words i know i'm not getting everything out, but this is long enough as it is. i'm sorry it's so lengthy. if you really read all that then thank you. if you didn't i don't blame you. kind words are very much appreciated."
"Usually I manage my mental health alright. There are a lot of ups and downs but normally I find ways to cope.  But there are days where it's really bad and I can never figure out why. It's usually completely out of the blue and has no warning. I wake up and know I won't be able to do anything that day. I end up lying on the couch on my phone (or just doing nothing) for hours. I can't leave my house and I don't feel like doing anything.   Everything feels incredibly heavy, I feel utterly disconnected from everyone and completely alone, and that weird I'm right on the verge of tears feeling. Anything can push me over the edge. It's like an actual physical pain that lasts for hours. Then there's the usual wave of dangerously negative thoughts I can't distract myself from. I feel like I'm underplaying the severity of how bad it feels but there's the gist of it.   Does anyone have similar experiences and how to cope when you feel this way? Anything effective to distract yourself or control the emotions until they pass? Thanks all."
"Hope this is the right place, and I'll try to make this short and to the point.   I was raised by both of my grandparents, so in essence they were my parents. After high school my grandpa's Alzheimer's was rapidly progressing. I stayed with them to help my grandmother care for him for several years before leaving for college. After discussing it with then, they both agreed that I should go and live my own life.   One year after I left my grandfather died. I had only seen him once in that year and can admit that I don't deal with death well. I was devastated for several years and felt immense guilt for leaving. My grandmother moved in with my aunt and was neglected (lost dentures that were never replaced, filthy house, bugs). It made me so sad when I would go and see her which I did more often once I moved back to the same state. But, three years later she suffered a severe stroke. I went to see her at the hospital and was alone with her for an extended period of time (uncles went to get some food). This was extremely hard for me to see her like this and pretend to be strong...I broke down and started crying in front of her. She held my hand and wouldn't let go...all I wanted to do was leave, so I pulled away from her. Told her I loved her and had to go...and I left. She died the next day...  Well, 8 years later and I still feel so much guilt over not staying there with her, but I was selfish and couldn't stay. It feels better to share this, but does anybody have advice on resolution or letting go of something like this?  Thanks for reading all of this."
"So recently (one month) I've began working at this huge senior community clubhouse/lodge for residents who live nearby. The lodge sits alone about 2 miles from any homes. I'm doing overnight maintenance and floor polishing from 9pm to 5:30am. Anyway, I work all alone and have recently become extremely paranoid. if I don't have any music playing it's too quiet and I become very scared. I start imagining it's haunted or someone is watching me from outside the big black windows, but than if I have the music playing too loud, I feel the same way. The first couple weeks were fine because I knew there was a co-worker doing the floor polishing on the other side of the building and new I wasn't alone. Since she moved to another shift, due to the fact I can handle it by myself, I haven't felt right. So question, am I developing some sort of mental illness or is this normal for some people to get very scared being alone at night? I've never experienced such fear and I know I'm not a wacko or schizo, etc. because before I get to work and after I leave, I feel completely normal again and have normal thoughts. It's only being alone at work...at night Thanks"
"I'm really struggling with a depressive phase in Bipolar || ... anybody have any tips to help me feel a little better? Honestly NOTHING has helped, I feel like I can't enjoy anything anymore. I'm on two different anti-depressants so where do I go from here..?"
"[Initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5r9nue/wife_checked_herself_into_an_inpatient_behavioral/?utm_content=thumbnail&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)  So my wife has been inside for four days. She's called every night after dinner and we've talked for 30 min to an hour each time. She seems to be making progress, and sounds like she is much happier and upbeat when we talk, but it's clear that the separation is straining her too. She's made friends, talked about issues, her doctor put her on a med for anxiety, then a med for depression that also helps her with the neuropathy pain she experiences, so that's good.   Myself, I have been numb. Just numb to the whole thing, and when I talked my mind off this giant mountain of emotion, I can laugh a little bit. But the conversation will eventually drift back to something she did or said or a hobby we used to share. And then I'm right back to weeping. I haven't had a good cry about this situation yet, sobbing and bawling, snot all down my face, can't speak inteligiblely. But it is getting better for me. I'm accepting that this is not a betrayal, it is a great trust placed in me... well, starting to accept. It's still a little raw.   But I am feeling even more that I did the right thing. She researched the hospital, researched others, found what benefits she had, delayed intake for a day to spend a last night together. Had she delayed much longer, she likely would have gotten a bit better, life isn't so bad, and I don't think I need to go inpatient. I was the one who woke her up on the big day, got her out out bed and showered, helped pack her backpack and clothes. I was effectively pushing the process along without realiasing what I was effectively doing was pushing her towards the unknown; the psych ward. She thanked me for gently forcing her to go.  She also tells me she is proud of me for taking care of the mundane stuff, such as filling out all the forms needed for the insurance, getting a few thing she forgot, feeding our cats.and tomorow she has asked for me to bring many paperback books to donate, and several puzzles of varying difficulty. Donate because her and her friends want them in there.  It is getting easier to see that she told me and asked me to help her because she trusts me. I haven't failed, I just got assigned the details parts because she knew I could handle it. Still stings, but not as much. She tells the other ladies stories about me and our antics and how I helped with her decision. I'm now apparently the husband od the year in their eyes. I'm just holding it together right now, I will need her strength when she gets out.   My music list punked me when driving today. What's the first song on the playlist? She's Gone, by hall &amp; oates. Followed immediately by the Sheryl crow song are you man to be my man. If that isn't a punking, i don't know what is.   Here's to a good solid hour of holding my baby so close tomorrow."
"This is going to be a hard one to explain.   I fist noticed this when I was sixteen, while I was in a severe low, shortly before a suicide attempt that resulted in a months stay in a psych ward. My brother, a year and a half older than me, was bugging me. Not unusual. We have that kind of relationship where teasing each other is the same as saying I love you. But then he made a comment about my weight. I'm very self conscious, so I didn't like that. Before I could stop myself, I had swung around and slapped him across the face. Hard. Both him and my mom were too stunned to say anything, as I've never done anything violent before.   But it felt amazing. It was like this rush of pure adrenaline that nothing could ever match. I mean, I felt bad about it later, but for at least an hour after the incident I was thrilled. I've noticed that same feeling whenever I lose my temper with my parents and yell or scream or insult them. I know it's horrible. I have anger issues that I need to learn to control. But should it feel this good?  I'm living in a group home now and in a severe low again. I'm worried I'll lose my temper with my roommates or god forbid the wonderful woman who runs this place. I like it here, I don't want to be kicked out, but what if I lose my temper again? I don't want to but a part of me wants to feel that rush that can only be brought on by causing someone else pain.   I experimented a bit with S&amp;M with my ex-girlfriend, even though I rarely experience sexual desire, but I did find out I'm into domination. Could that have anything to do with it?"
Has anyone had any success with OTC Medicine or herbs to help with depression and anxiety? I need something to help calm me down but I don't have insurance yet.
"What is life but a series of events unfolding before our very eyes, thrust upon us and modeled after the choices we have made? We must be held accountable for those choices and those decisions, the poor ones as well as the good. I know life is precious and that it is a gift, fleeting by with every tick of the clock. Sometimes it seems unfair. Some suffer while others flourish. Some manage to find a semblance of peace, while others find every day to be a constant battle.   A friend of mine lost that battle a few months ago. He was truly one of the kindest, most gentle souls I have met throughout my life. He was positive, adventurous, strong (both physically and mentally). He was a true inspiration, a hero, my hero. Though he was many years younger, I looked up to him. I saw within him many of the qualities I wished I could possess. In truth, I was not only in awe of him, but also jealous of him, and to be completely honest a little smitten.   Everything that he was, the glow he radiated, his bright smile, all of his kind words, all of it faded quickly into darkness. His face changed. No longer did we see him smile. No longer did he have the confidence to do the simplest tasks. He was dying from the inside out. After physically and psychologically being affected by an elective surgery, all of his demons came to life and plagued him, breaking him down more and more each day. Despite all who loved him reaching out to catch him, all of the professional help he received, those demons swallowed him up.   Now I am left to wonder about life. It is worth living and worth fighting every single day for something better. I know that it is. Yet, what I believed about the universe has been shaken, if not shattered. I used to think that there was balance to the universe, that there are things that just work out the way they are supposed to -of course not all the time- but I thought... for someone like him... there is just no reason... There is no justice, no fairness, no hidden lesson to be unraveled from this... It just plain sucks!   I know that I should do my utmost best to be the person he saw in me. I should live my life in a way that could make him proud, proud of the person he chose to call his friend. I just don't know how...   Some of the things that I do, that I think, that I am... I think they would disappoint him.   It makes me wonder if I were to be my truest self, that I would disappoint everyone that I cared about. I just keep finding myself making the wrong choices, or, worse yet, being indecisive and hesitating to make the right ones...

"I know that this probably sounds stupid, but I'm being completely serious. I'm fifteen, and I used to go to therapy. For nearly seven years actually. I have two, diagnosed, anxiety disorders. My mom pulled me out a couple of years ago.   A lot has happened since then, including my mom being investigated for emotional abuse. But, the main reason I'm posting here is because I have to go back to therapy now, at least to be evaluated.   Part of my anxiety disorder is a horrible fear of medication. I can hardly take an Advil without having a panic attack. My mom knows this, but she continuously says thing like, Do you really want to go back to therapy? They're just going to put you on medication. And it's really hard because it sort of sounds like a threat.   Anyways, my main question for you guys is, if I do get put on medication, is that okay? My mom makes it sound like I won't be myself anymore and that kind of makes me more scared."
"My pipedream is to start an organization that is open 24/7 for people who just need somewhere to go to add a little wellness to their lives immediately, mostly for mental purposes. Imagine if, when you're feeling alone and sad or having a panic attack, there were a place nearby where you can talk to someone anytime or take a fitness class to help take care of yourself. In this facility, I'd love to have classes for all kinds of things- meditation, altruism, helping men express their emotions, lgbt, etc. also spaces to get exercise, people to talk to, and literature for dealing with mental illness. What other suggestions do you guys have for something like this?"
"Ever since I was little, I just sometimes get the feeling that I'm going to die soon. I remember being about to turn 10 and really really believing that I would die before my 10th birthday, and I was counting down the days to my birthday and making sure to tell my parents constantly that I loved them because I was really convinced I wasn't going to live to see 10. That's my earliest memory of this happening and probably the first time I felt this way, but still every now and then I'll really feel like I'm going to die, especially at night in my sleep. Often, like tonight, I'll stay up and keep myself from falling asleep out of fear that I'll die if I fall asleep. It's currently 4:25 a.m. and I have things to do tomorrow, but I'm scared to go to sleep. I've even written hidden letters for my friends and family to find in case I do die, but I've never told anyone because I don't want it to seem like I'm writing suicide notes. Is this unusual or is it something that everyone experiences?"
"Hi redditors, posting here because I feel like this doesn't qualify to be on r/depression (been reading through and everything sounds really serious in comparison to my situation...) So,  Lately I've been doing some googling on depression, including mild depression vs sadness which hasn't helped my understanding all that much. I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice and hope this doesn't sound too naive or overdramatic. Sigh, just going to list a bunch of facts/questions:  Been feeling more down and tired than usual over the last month or so + reacting more easily lately (eg. tearing up/getting irritated over smaller things), self-harmed 4/5 times in the past month* which is the most frequently I ever have (but as far as self harm goes not very seriously and never considered suicide), feeling like I've drifted from/lost most of my close friends, been wanting to sleep more often just so I don't have to be awake but still not getting enough hours because I tend to procrastinate a lot, feeling stressed/guilty for not keeping on top of study particularly at night, I know exercise should help but I CBS so often :/ *also feel like I can't currently talk to my best friend about it because although he knows I have self harmed in the past he doesn't know it has continued and has mentioned that if I did again he'd feel like he'd failed as a friend (so not too keen on telling him before he understands it doesn't indicate his failure in any way).  On the other hand I still do enjoy music/reading and am genuinely happy with friends and at church (not having to always fake emotions while I'm actually dead on the inside like so many websites seem to say). I get the impression though that when someone is actually depressed and not just 'down', they experience these depressed/empty feelings virtually constantly and can't find pleasure in things they used to enjoy. (So can I infer from me enjoying life this much that I have nothing to worry about?)  As far as 'risk factors' for mental health issues go, I haven't been diagnosed with anything (though have had symptoms of trichotillomania). However my sister has been diagnosed with anxiety (have wondered if she has been depressed but not sure), and my aunt and grandmother have both suffered depression in the past.  I apologise if this has sounded insensitive and know that other people have it unbelievably worse. Although I kind of doubt my situation would even register on the scale of depression I really hope that this experience is not just a normal part of life and would just like some clarity :/ Thanks for reading"
"like today i keep having delusions, paranoia. ive been to a prescriber but all they will prescribe are antidepressants. i went to an emergency room and they wont help at all.   how do i get medicine to treat my symptoms? why does everyone that i see refuse to diagnose me?"
"How bad am I ?  The online test site says:  Your rumination score is 62.0. The scale ranges from 22 to 88 points. In the Nolen-Hoeksma et al. study of 1999, it was found that women scored on average 42.0 and men 39.6."
"I have insurance but I can't afford to use it. I can't afford therapy anymore. I was getting treatment for depression, anxiety, and impulsivity. I feel okay and stable now after six months of therapy but I'm worried that if I don't go to therapy I might slip back into unstable and negative patterns. What other options are available for people who need to maintain mental health? I really liked having someone to check my thoughts and focus--it felt like I was getting stronger and healthier, mentally. Please help me think of options for maintaining my mental health! Grateful I got some therapy in before they changed the plan."
"Like said in the title, I have an anxiety disorder(actually as well as panic disorder). I was prescribed with medication for my anxiety, and I started taking the meds almost two months ago. I have a boyfriend who I love to the moon and back, and he is super supportive, but finds it sometimes hard to understand my situation. He is making my life better, but sometimes I start worrying if he will love me also in the future, because we've felt like we want to stay together for a long, long time.  We broke up but got back together again, and the reason for the break up was my anxiety issues. When we got back together, things were a bit difficult but now things are better than ever. However I somehow feel like I'm looking for trouble although everything is fine in my life. I have felt like this before and got over it, now it started again. I have tried meditation and warm/cold therapy. I am also going to a therapy every two weeks.  Would someone have any tips on how making my brain shut down so that I would not think about bullshit and come up with problems?  Thank you in advance!â¤  Tl;dr: I have anxiety and panic disorders. Everything is fine in my life, still I feel like I'm looking for trouble and feelinf anxious for no reason. Any tips how to stop thinking about bullshit?"
"I've been thinking so much for the past days and I can feel it's effect on my brain. Like there is a bunch of information I'm trying to process at once. I can't talk to anyone about it. I can't go to a therapist. I am normally not scared of things, but as it stands now I'm scared I've gone too deep in my own thoughts and can't get out. Is this it?"
"I began my PhD last August. Since then, I caught MRSA (Methilliciin Resistant Staph Aureus) and had numerous abcesses and styes.  I have decided to not take anymore antibiotics, because after I took Sulfa, the bug is now even resistant to that. I'm saving for more serious infections.  It is now at a point that its affecting my mental well being. My regular doctor visits, infection pain and sickness in general is taking a toll on my academic life.   When I began my PhD, I felt powerful and capable in making an impact in science. Now I struggle to study for classes/go to the lab.  Though not as deadly as cancer, MRSA shares its trait of always striking again. This is what's making me sad. I know that even if I recover from my current bout, its going to come back in a week or a month and the cycle will start all again.   Thankfully my current infections are limited to the skin, though if MRSA goes into the blood, I've read that weeks of hospitalization is needed. This scares me a lot.  We all grow up with the notion that, if you take your meds, you get better. I'm slowly learning, as I grow up, that everything isn't as black and white. There aren't quick answers to certain things such as MRSA.   I just need to stay strong and motivated as the future unfolds. How do you guys suggest I do that?"
"I have privately lent my mom's boyfriend around $15,000 grand over the past nine months. It was to help with the electric,medication, etc. They continued to go out to eat,drink, and shop. He kept promising to repay me, just as soon as a sale when through. He made one repayment of $500 two months ago. Well, now I got a letter from him asking for the $500 back- and I actually gave it. So I wrote him note stating that I'm not seeing any effort to repay me and I expect him to cut unnecessary costs. They are now on an overnight trip to an amusement park.  I am upset with myself for allowing this to happen. I am angry and afraid. I have no way of paying off these credit cards without him repaying me. I have made so many sacrifices just to make the minimum payments.  I don't think he is capable of changing his lifestyle. The whole thing just feels like it added up so quickly and I foolishly kept believing any week I'd receive a check. I still am clinging on to that, I admit. I feel used. I don't have anyone in my life I can trust. There is no one to help me. I have no confidence.  *I also posted on offmychest, I'm not sure what in appropriate, I just know I'm sad."
"Dunno if this is the appropriate zone but here I go anyway.  Things happened and now I've got some problems (thanks to my father). I've always been shy and introvert, but now it's kind of annoying what my problems are causing me. (Please don't mock me, I can't even tells my family about this. (If my age can help: 16)  Some of my problems;  -I'm self conscious  -can't go outside shutout wearing my hoodie ( some says I'm anorexic) -I have ARFID disorder (also known as SED) -Social anxiety -And i may have Psychotic depression  With this said, I can't go get medical help for that (or services) Even writing this I'm shaky. And this is the first time I'm telling this. I don't know what to do anymore."
I'm a 17 year old male. When I was younger (I can't remember exactly what age) I was molested my older female cousin. I'm not sure if it was nuetrul because I can remember not liking it. She made me touch her too. I have always tried to be kind to people so when I got bullied in my later school years I never really fought back. I gained a lot of weight by the time I was 12. I'm trying to lose weight now though. My grades also got really bad. I stopped smiling and didn't really have any friends accept my cat. Even would sit and talk to him. I cried myself to sleep many nights and hated myself. My parents told me to smile more and got on me about my grades. That's also when I started having conversations with myself. Now in high school i thought things would get better. I was wrong. I though being bullied by girls was bad but boys verbally and physically bully you. My sophomore year this kid who got held back was in my class. In electronics class he would tackle me and throw the tools at me. He did this with his other friend. He even stabbed me with a screwdriver and I bled through my pants. (It wasn't serous though) then one day he throw something at me and something inside me just snapped. I ran over to him and punched him several times and kneed him in the stomach. I was about to kick him in the neck but I stopped myself. And my fellow class mates just laughed and asked me to tell them when I was going to shoot up the school. I cried because I was ashamed at what I had done to him. The next day I was called down to the deans office because they said that students had been saying I was going to bring a gun to school. They believed them over me. But they believed me in the end. This year(my junior year) I made a friend who has no polar disorder. He showed me videos of animal abuse in Slaughter houses. At first I was disgusted but as I watched more and more I got hooked. I have tried to stop but I know scared I'm a sadist now. I'm pretty sure I have depression. Feeling like your drowning in your mind everyday. I have taken many mental illness tests online. And now I'm not sure if I'm just faking it... I just don't know anymore. I'm not even sure about my sexuality anymore. (I wanted to add I have never told anyone this much about my self ever)
"TW sexual abuse, abuse, depression   I need to know do things really get better?  I'm struggling so much right now between school and trying to find work and dealing with all of my issues.   I was diagnosed complex ptsd, social anxiety, general anxiety and depression.  I suffered multiple traumas throughout my childhood and teenage years, mostly sexual in nature. I just started therapy a few weeks ago.  I feel hopeless. I got a dog because I thought it might help but I only feel worse. I need to know if it will get better because I am so tired."
"Hi, this is my first post.  I have suffered with diagnosed general anxiety disorder and panic disorder throughout my teen and early twenties. I have those under control without medication. I just wanted to mention that as it might be related. Let me start with what happened and then how I feel and hopefully I can get some advice on what I can do.  I used to have a hobby of filming things and editing them at home with some crappy software. About 12 years ago, when I was in college and about 22, I was at a party and filming some random people enjoying themselves. During this time a few girls decided to flash me their boobs. Skip forward a few months and I decided to edit the boob flashing into a short stupid video and added it to a few other videos I edited on a DVD. The video I edited said Boobies n' sluts edited onto it in a way that sluts was emphasized, right before the scenes of the girls flashing. I thought it was funny at the time and now it disgusts me.  Fast forward 12 years and I was moving the last few personal items from my parents basement and cannot find those dvds. I know somebody has them but I don't know who. I am absolutely obsessing about the videos being shared online and humiliating those poor girls and me insulting them on a video because they most likely have never seen it. It's driving me crazy. I can't sleep, food doesn't taste good and the thoughts of what could happen if they saw the video posted online keeps looping and looping in my head and making me cry and squirm. I am very remorseful of the hurtful words I typed on the screen but I have no idea how to resolve this and move on with my life.   I have been to my doctor about it and he suggested to put me on Cipralex 10mg to reduce my anxiety over it but I have not started that yet. My brain just keeps looping all the possible scenarios if the video was posted online and I don't think Cipralex would help. I do have an appointment with a behavior counselor in a few days but can anyone tell me something I can do just to ease my mind. At least for one night.   I don't know what to do about this guilt and I feel like I am going crazy over this. It's been 22 days of nonstop worrying about this. When I say nonstop, I mean it."
"Hello,  I have been suffering from several mental health issues for years including autism, severe depression, moodswings, personality disorders and anxiety.  In the past I have been admitted to several mental hospitals and I have continuously been in therapy as well. I have made progress, even though very little, but I know I cannot do this on my own much longer.  For five years now I have been put on medication to help me treat my symptoms and alleviate the suffering. The majority of these had no effect on me whatsoever. A couple of them did, but my body reacted badly to them and I had to stop taking them.  I am afraid I will run out of options medication-wise and no suitable options will ever be found for me. This makes me even more anxious and feel hopeless.  Do you guys have any advice on what to do? Have you been in a similar sitution?"
"I'm depressed and sick, been like this for weeks, I just don't see the point. Even if I got healthy again won't I just die soon thereafter, anyways? Why not just take my life now? What hope do ANY of us have as mortal human beings?"
"Good day everyone I have a friend, female in her mid 30s who stopped, cold turkey taking her medicines. A week ago, Saturday, she decided after only several months of being on her medicines to quit - because it was planned to have a surgery yesterday. She did have the surgery and I went to check up on her at home. (Cosmetic breast surgery) For most of her life she has been a quick - heavy - twitching sleeper.  I have seen before in the past how she can be, quite down and almost in a daze. It's weird to explain, but I hope some can understand. She has taken since the surgery 48 hours ago, 3 or 4 percocets, but by Monday should be done with pain prescriptions.  Could going cold turkey be dangerous to your health? Are the withdrawal symptoms serious enough to make you worse? She hAs been I would say mildly sedated, but even before the surgery she was off the medicines for 5 days. During that time there was no noticeable signs and was actually perfectly fine.  thanks!"
"Someone very close to me has confided in me something that has happened to them - something serious; traumatic to the point of expressing traits similar to that of post traumatic stress disorder. They've only told me, and a recent situation has put them under immense stress for some time now. They don't want to seek help for fear of seeming broken, and right now I'm the only person that knows and that they trust. At their request I've contacted a professional for consultation but at the wishes of the friend we haven't proceeded yet. I don't want to violate their trust by going behind their back with the professional, but I'm scared that waiting won't make the situation better. How can I help them seek help without violating their trust? It's an awful situation, but the resources are right here and already paid for; it's a matter of having my friend want to solve this issue.  Please, what can I do?"
"Throwaway account but any support at all would be really appreciated. I've been having the worst year (school year), and I'm so close to running out of options. [Trigger warning for depression, suicidal thoughts, mental illness stuff and general negativity.]  I've struggled with mental illness my entire life. My parents never took me seriously, and although they did try to support me when things get really bad, they always believed that my problems were a burden and that if I just tried hard enough I could get better. But I've been trying all my life. I know I'm young, I'm 18, it's just so fucked up that for 2/3 of my time alive I've been actively struggling with all this. It's taken over my life.  I'm in university now and my parents thought, without any discussion with me whatsoever, that it'd be a good idea for me to live by myself rather than with roommates or in residence. They secured this long term place without consulting me at all beforehand and now because of financial reasons I'm stuck here for the long term, going home by myself every day whilst my friends live together and grow closer together. I hate living by myself. I fall through the cracks every once in a few days. I can't take care of myself properly. Some days I can't leave the house. Other days I'm suicidal and it's by sheer force and I guess luck alone I haven't done anything. It's just dangerous as fuck especially since I live far away from anyone else and I have to go home by myself and eat dinner by myself every day.   Friends I thought I had eventually grew closer to each other as the semester went on. They made group chats without me in it, and I see them hanging out together on snapchat all the time. Even the one or two friends I thought I was genuinely close to. Because I live away from all other students I can't hang out with them too often. I just see them having late nights together and eating meals together and I'm stuck by myself for several more years. I don't know if I can make it. I can't stand it. I genuinely can't even count more than two people in the country who even care about me in any way. People have drifted away from me, and it's going to get so much worse next year when they form groups to rent places together and I'm stuck on my own, and they're together and have each other.  I have a lot of anxiety and everything. I'm fully convinced that almost everyone hates me, and even if they don't, that they don't really want me around anyways. They keep making plans together, forming new groups and chats and I'm never included anymore. I know I isolate myself sometimes, especially when my depression gets unbearable, but it hurts that no one cares enough to even check up on me. And I have too much anxiety to reach out. Even a few people I know who've struggled similarly with mental health issues last semester have now found their friend groups (in fact I introduced them to my friends and now they're closer with my old social circle and I'm cast out), they're dating people now, and I'm getting worse and worse. I know it's selfish as fuck but I can't help but be a bit bitter. All my life I've seen people struggle and get better, and I just can't seem to do it.  I've tried counselling, I've tried immersing myself in my hobbies and focusing on my studying, I've tried almost everything. It hurts so much. I'm sorry for ranting on here, it's the only place I have and I have nobody else to turn to. Fuck. I've been crying for almost the entire day and I'm completely drained."
"I've had my lows before but this is just unbelievable. I just... can't. Normally I can fake a smile and pretend everything's ok until everything *is* ok but this time I just can't pull it off. I feel like a robot and everything I do is mechanical. I can't even find the energy to eat. I've lost almost ten pounds in two weeks because I'm not eating. I'll maybe eat one small meal a day but that's pushing it. Three weeks ago I was super stoked about going to see marianas trench in concert, now I don't know if I can pull myself together enough to get out of bed, put on clothes, and make myself look decent. It's too much effort even just to see my roommates everyday. I'm so tired of this. I want to die. I've been storing up some of my medication, ready for that moment when it all goes to shot and I can't take it anymore. Life just doesn't seem worth living when I'm just barely surviving. What's the point? This happens to me every three goddamn months. I really thought I broke the cycle this time. I moved out of my parents basement, I was happy and for the first time in a long time I had hope. Now there's nothing. Nothing. Just nothingness. I'm hopeless. I'm worthless. I'm useless. A leech on society. I can't even hold down a job. I've been living off of social assistance ever since I turned 18. This world would be better off without me. My family would be happier without me. I just want it all to end. I could t even see this coming. I was to blinded by the false hope my medication gives me. Oh, I'm really anxious lately, but that's ok, im sure it's nothing! Oh damn, im constantly on the verge of tears, but im sure I'm fine! And then bam, crushing depression like I've never felt before. I can't deal with this anymore. No one can help me. I've tried so many medications. I've been institutionalized. My doctor wants to try ECT but I know it'll turn me into a living zombie and if that's what has to become of me to end this pain then I might as well kill myself right here and now. There's just no point in living anymore."
Lately I've just been feeling different. As if my life is a waste. I've also been suffering from these episodes I guess you can call them. I suddenly start feeling overwhelmed with emotion and the fact that one day everyone I love and myself will die regardless of how 'good' or 'bad' we do in this life. I have a little break down and just cry uncontrollably. Sometimes they last all night or just a few minutes depending where I am and if I can calm myself down. Is this something that happens to other people?
"Hi I'm 22/M, I'm a final year student at university, right up until mid December my university grades averaged 80%, I was doing very well and happy in myself  Then when I got my Christmas holidays I noticed I began to forget things like people's names but then I'd remember them about 5 minutes later, no one close just acquaintances or forgetting song names, I wasn't able to focus at all for my exams and did really poor, I tried but the concentration wasn't there, I have felt fatigued coupled with this the whole time.  I have been to the doctors and had blood tests and explained the situation, they prescribed my duloxetine but I don't feel my main issue is depression.  All my bloods came back normal but this memory issue and brain fog is destroying my life, I now find myself disconnected to all the people who matter in my life, I am finding it so hard to socialise with people and my state has progressed to a point were I am emotionally numb, just tired and stupid all day.  I am really really scared that this will destroy my life but I'm trying hard to stay positive and believing this too will pass. Can anyone related to this or shed any light on what this could be ?  Thank you"
"Pretty self explanatory post.  I keep hitting my girlfriend and it's ruining our relationship. I don't even know where to start explaining it, because I don't know why I do it.  I'm a 25year old female and she is 28.  Last night we got in our biggest fight ever. I found myself with my hands around her neck more times than I dare to count.  She stood there and cried whilst I repeatedly slapped her around the face. I have done this before in the past to a different partner and I grew up around violence and drugs.   It is like I know what i'm doing but I can't stop it and I get some sort of weird, disgusting high out of it.   Last night she called our housemate to come home, because she didn't feel safe around me. Her housemate's ex had BPD and did the same thing to her and she is very understanding and we sat there and talked it through once things had calmed down and today it's everyone is acting like its okay, even though every body knows its not.  I'm just rambling here because I don't know what else to say. Please can i have any advice you have and can answer any questions etc.  Please help me."
"On Friday Night, I txted my friend that I would be in his hometown in april with family and that maybe we will run into each other.  His response was: Fuck off, maybe give me a break. we'll get dinner lol.  I was really hurt by this and I txted him this yesterday saying so. he said it was just a joke and if I heard it in person It would not have hit me the way it did. He did apologize.  But Now I'm the one that feels bad thinking I over reacted or something. I'm a very sensitive person and I was crying pretty much all day yesterday.  The depressed voice in my head is telling me to feel bad I keep thinking he's mad at me now and he won't talk to me again.  Am I wrong to express how I felt?"
"Hi all, Something is wrong with my brain, in a sense that I can't seem to focus on doing revision or homework. This work NEEDS to be completed tomorrow as I have test, and soon my actual exam. Basically I want to get a good grade. I mean, who doesn't? I leave things to last minute and when I actually do end up revising, my brain half-asses it and I can't remember anything. Difficulty concentrating, I guess. What's weird, though, is that I can focus on learning a second language? I'm learning Spanish, and I can easily sit down for at least an hour a day and concentrate on that. I remember everything I've learned and I'm doing good. But I can't say the same about right now? Any suggestions? What's wrong with me mentally? Please, I don't want to fail this important exam.  Gracius ;)"

"Do you guys have times when you think that you think or feel this or that way but end up doing opposite stuff? Is that some kind of a disorder? For example you thought you hate this guy/girl but end up asking them out and you are like what just happened? Or you thought you would love to have a certain kind of job, but once you get it, you turn it down before even trying it out and you don't really know why. Since action speaks louder than words, is the action part of you the true you in this case, and the thoughts and feelings before that are just you trying to fool yourself? Has anyone had luck fixing this?"
"Last night I had a dream about my ex-girlfriend from my first real and long-term relationship. I was only 19 at the time so we're talking like 11 years ago, and then I haven't seen or heard from her in almost 10 years now. But the dream made me feel so wonderful while I had it--so alive again--and when I awoke I felt such complete misery. And more than an hour later it feels like it's really only intensifying.  I have very, very intense anxiety (and various anxiety-related disorders) and housebound agoraphobia (currently haven't left in 402 days) and that certainly doesn't help matters. But as far as depression goes, it's always because of something, not necessarily for no reason; I'll think of a person, the way that I felt in another time in my life (especially before getting sick like I am now), and specifically about being younger.  I know that it's normal to get sad about things like that, but I don't think it's normal for it to happen constantly and to stick around and make me feel actively depressed.   I guess I just wanted to get that out because I don't really talk about it to anyone. The fastest way to lose friends (which I have nearly none of anymore, anyway) is to talk about your problems to them. I found that out the hard way."
"I feel so upset having to type this, but it's how I feel. I make art as a student. I'm 19 years old. on an art site and post art and in 3 months I have 130 followers.  My work gets lots of comments and favs, and compliments such as 'you're so talented friend!' 'gosh I want to be just like you! you're so good and professional!' Yet at the same time I feel like they don't mean it and they're laughing behind my back and I'm waiting for the day they all turn around and say stuff like 'you childish idiot' or 'your art sucks I was joking to fool around with ya hahaha''  These thoughts aren't something I've had all the time, it started when I made that account and got compliments. used to have an account on that site but it was years ago and i deactivated it. I was prescribed prozac mid November. I think it made my tinnitus come back because sometimes I swear I hear the doorbell go and rush to the door but nobody's there. In recent months I just feel like I can't relax and I've also been taking Zopiclone 7.5 mg every other day.   Posting this on a throwaway account because I don't want to offend or inform anyone who might be following my account. My self esteem is low, but I feel like my art is pretty good, but I feel like even I am lying to myself?   I THINK I remember when I was 15 and Prozac made me hear my own voice (in distorted form) coming from my room upstairs. I went to check but no one there. Went off Prozac until few months ago. I NEED Prozac though, I have severe depression which alternates between manic cycles my mood can swing violently.   I've stalked my online art 'friends', checking through their activity and history as well as closely analyzing their words because I'm suspicious of everyone. I actually get very anxious and scared when I receive a message in my inbox that I've got feedback on some artwork or something I posted like I get ready for the big confrontation or reveal like they're ALL going to take their masks off.  I'm crying I'm not sure why"
I want to cut cut cut.... I've been clean for 13 months. I have no real reason for this other than the tingle on my wrist for me to do it. But I know if I do it I will feel guilty and awful about it and regress into a depressive state. I don't want that.. urgh this is frustrating :( I've come so far...
"I'm going to admit to you right now that this is a post for attention, but mainly because I am so lonely.  I recently found out I wasn't just clinically depressed, but I have a mild form of bipolar depression. I'm currently cycling and yesterday I had a decent day, but now I'm sinking. I've spent the better half of today playing Fallout, but finding little joy and using it more of a distraction than anything else. I have friends, I recently moved to a new place with way better roommates than my last residence, and I also recently took up a new job with a wonderful staff.  Despite all this, I still feel lost and empty. I am being treated and I also go to counseling, but I still hurt myself and some days I still just want to die. I hate myself for not being ok. I try to focus on all the good change that has come in the past few weeks, but I feel like I'm losing it. I no longer have an excuse to be sad, and that makes me feel worse. I feel like I can't talk to my friends about how sad I am, because it'll just feel like I'm complaining for no reason, which it feels like I am.  I would love some advice."
"For about 3 years I have been having some problems with my mental health on and off, more on than off though. I will have bouts of depression, paranoia, anger, bitterness, envy, just all very negative emotions where I just hate everyone around me or I hate the person I am - for example, I hate how weak I am, especially in relationships, I hate how promiscuous I am, I hate how I have no willpower, no motivation, I'm lazy etc. I've been thinking about counselling for a long time as I feel like I would benefit from it but I'm just too embarrassed to talk to a complete stranger about my personal issues, I'm worried they'd judge me. I'm not very good vocalising my inner feelings, my mind gets really caught up in knots when I try to talk. I feel like I can truly express how I feel by writing it down because I can think about it better. Help?? Any suggestions? :/"
"I've made different posts before about this in the past few days/hours, but I'm not doing it for karma or anything else besides help or advice. I will type as though I'm talking with medical professionals even though I'm sure there aren't any here.  I'll get to what I want to talk about first, my mental health ever since Monday of this week has **plummeted** to put it lightly.  I'm 22, live with my mother and I have depression and an unspecified anxiety disorder (because my doctor didn't want to put a label on me) but I'm sure it's at least generalized anxiety disorder, I take Klonopin, Buspar and Celexa under prescription by my doctor. My anxiety has gone completely out of control and my Klonopin is doing next to nothing.  So I'm here to ask if *anyone* can tell me of a medication I can ask a doctor to prescribe to me to put my anxiety to tolerable levels, and unfortunately I'm too skeptical to try any of the non-medication treatment options. I truly am sorry if you don't think you can help or give advice, but I can't see a doctor until tomorrow.  I'm in no danger of hurting myself or anyone else around me, but I'm considering going to a mental hospital because I feel as though I can't get the treatment I need, but on the flip-side I don't want to go because I've heard horror stories about the places and they seem like a nightmare to go through and I'm not sure I'll make it out of there alive mentally."
"Anyone else have this problem. For as long as i can remember, ive never fekt like i enjoy things. Like i dont have hobbies or any form of art that i enjoy doing. Its like i dont know how to have fun? Im fairly happy considering my past mental health record but like...if someone were to say, what do you do for fun? or what do you find fun? i would be like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  anyone else feel this way? its kinda frustrating, but somehow i get through the weeks being fairly content"
"Mods if this is in the wrong area please help me find the right area to ask my questions.  I just took my first cirpalex about 3 hours ago, and now.. I don't ever remember being do drowsy. I almost fell asleep at work.   This is my only complaint so far, so that's good, but will the drowsiness go away?"
What's wrong with me!! At first I blamed it on them said I just wasn't w the right guys but it's to the point where there's been so many guys it couldn't have been all of them. It's me. I just can't look past that one flaw. I try to so bad but it's like as soon as I see that one flaw I can't get past it. I tell myself not to settle. That if I date a guy that I don't 100% (even 90%) like I am settling.
"Excuse me if this has been posted here before, but anytime a story on the main page is related to mental health, the comments are flooded with misunderstanding, non-compassionate responses , or straight up hatred. It's sad to see people laugh it off or discard the issue from analysis."
"From my point of view, the universe is deterministic and therefore nihilistic. I cope with this through avoidance, digital entertainment mainly. But every so often the thought comes back and I find myself in an existential crisis. I lose all motivation, and have suicidal urges. I have managed to make it through these periods my whole life, but I do not know if I can continue to do so. This lasts until I manage to distract myself again, which can take anywhere from a few hours to a week. Most of the time though, when I'm not in a crisis, I have no passion for anything other than consuming digital entertainment for a brief high in an otherwise miserable existence. I do not understand, I am an upper-middle class white male with nothing to worry about, but I am plagued by anxiety and depression. My problem is twofold. First, my basic state is misery. Second, I have periods of crisis that are even worse. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I'm being medicated. The medication helps, but even with it I am miserable. I hate the person I am without them: angry, scared, and sad. I have tried therapy, which helped to a point and then stopped working. I hate this, and I do not know what to do. I am sorry for rambling, and I hope this made sense."
How long does it really take?  I just find it so dissapointing where every session I measure my progress and don't see any at all. I literally just wait for it to kick in but it doesn't kick in. Are you supposed to even feel anything from therapy? And if it takes a ridiculously long time like 6+ months to improve just a little bit then what the hell is the point? Doesn't seem worth it to me. I want to see tangible improvement week to week if I am going to pay ~ $100 ish per session.   I really don't have that kind of time to just wait for therapy to kick in. I'm already with a new therapist recently as of winter break so its been 6+ weeks and still nothing. This isn't my first therapist either but around my 4th.  And this is CBT btw.
"My therapist gave me info about mistaken beliefs: the idea that we develop ideas or theories that aren't true. I realized mine were thoughts I developed in childhood like, nobody cares about me, why should I (care about me), others' well-being is more important than mine, and other thoughts that go along the lines of feeling worthless.  I also realized that when I'm anything less than a 100% ok I hide, and that it was because I was shamed when I was a kid everytime I felt unwell. I have good friends, but I always hesitate to tell them when something is wrong in spite of needing help, because of the mistaken belief that I'll be shamed for it.  Idk how to overcome my fear and wariness. I'm half venting and half lost."
"Hello, Im here for some advice.  Me and my girlfriend have been together for a few months now and she is a amazing strong person, however she has some issues regarding mental health that we want to work together in getting the treatment and help she needs.  This is a throwaway for obvious reasons and im not going to name names or locations for mine and her protection but i want to get across the severity of the situation and whats best to help her.  When she was younger there was some sexual abuse that has manifested with her to this day and i think that has had a huge part in her mental issues. She hears voices sometimes that she describes to me as a type of paranoia, it doesn't effect her so much but they are still around occasionally.   The real worry for us is she tells me she feels like there is a different person there. We will go out and be find all week and one day she will suddenly be like a different person who knows who I am am but will be hostile and argumentative about allot of things. She can snap out of it if she feels grounded to herself but in itself that is a worry and I want to help her in any way I can.  She is incredibly loving and strong and a amazing person, and I have to say she does not at all come across as mentally ill at a face to face level 99% of the time, but when this certain mood hits or whatever it is she can go a little Loopy -her words and we really want to find a way to work through this.   One last thing is she has told me that once before in the past she has not remembered periods of time due to this Other person being on control I guess??   She is a fantastic girl, but allot has happened and she has had no support over the years to help her.   What Can i do and we do to get her through this?  Please Help!!  Please."
"I'm having a mental health assessment later this month but I just feel I'm losing my grip on reality by the day  This is what I'm going to tell them, I hope I can see a psychiatrist, sick of them guessing at treating me  [ ] Was in good, normal mood then went on reddit about BPD thing and related to it all and mood plummeted to believing I was crazy and that I'd never be fixed and saw myself in the negative symptoms listed like black and white thinking and having a favorite person I'm obsessed with - noticed by others  [ ] Swing wildly from depressed to ecstatic when favourite person gives me attention and am just happy they pay attention despite saying to myself that I'd begin to just write it off because they hadn't given me time of day - noticed by others  [ ] Extreme dependency on others for personal happiness - noticed by others  [ ] Extreme change in thoughts from hate to love for minor triggers, no shades of grey  [ ] Dissociation during stressful events - has led more than once to molestation and inaction  [ ] Constantly searching for some identity in other things - putting high stock in personality tests and getting upset when they don't match  [ ] Worrying about having personality disorders - having to admit I'm fundamentally flawed but kind of wanting a diagnosis to figure out what is wrong  [ ] Caught in the same loop of okay &gt; sad &gt; devastated &gt; ecstatic &gt; okay  [ ] Cannot sit with internal world or I constantly dwell on flaws OR I think I'm the best there is - doesn't seem to be an in-between  [ ] Have always downplayed symptoms at mental health checks or forgotten to mention some - shameful to mention to professionals  [ ] Constantly ask for validation from others - ask for good traits for affirmation and am preoccupied with being liked by others, even people that I don't like - this has been pointed out to me  [ ] I feel I've no foothold in my inner world, like my personality is constantly in flux - like I can't stick to one self - not multiple personalities because I'm still always myself, but who is me? Outgoing, friendly, charming, or cold hearted, manipulative and cunning? Have no sense of perception when it comes to myself  [ ] Mood swings vary from day to day and are triggered, but are completely overblown - being ignored and not replied to sends me suicidal  [ ] I know when I'm overreacting but I cannot sit with emotions - they are too strong and thoughts can't reframe my state of being, so eventually they end up shifting to match my turbulent emotions  [ ] Increasing urges for self destructive behaviour - resisting urges to mess with anti depressants and take too many or too few - have been wanting to self harm and often need to force myself to interact with others so I don't harm myself instead with my inner state  [ ] Mental health has worsened recently - all symptoms have always been present but I've never been able to gather all of them at once during an assessment because I always downplay my problems when it's time to see a doctor  [ ] Heavy feelings of emptiness and disconnection from others - only really able to connect when drinking"
"Depression, or 'the black dog' as it is better known, is an evil manipulator that will pollute an already fragile mind. A dark overcast will take control of your life, making the most simplest of tasks near on impossible. Take the mother out of About a Boy for instance, crying over a bowl of cereal. It may sound silly but it happens. You either cry too much or not at all, there is no in between.   You are worthless - Depression chips away at your self-confidence. Your hopes and dreams will be shattered into a million pieces as you will become convinced that there is no point in trying as you will fail anyway.   It is because of this that I contemplated quitting my undergraduate degree numerous times. My work was rubbish so what was the point in making myself poorly in order to reach deadlines? Wrong. With help and guidance I achieved a 2.1 overall, 0.6% off a first though (gutted!).   You're a burden- A common one. You don't smile or laugh anymore. You sleep a lot, cancel plans, and have to be reminded to shower, eat and sleep. You're a grown adult, shouldn't you be doing these things for yourself? Wrong again. I know myself that during a bad dip I will revert to being a child in an adult's world. I will need reminding to wash my clothes and keep my flat tidy.   I will need a telling off for eating chocolate, cereal and pot noodles as opposed to healthy, nutritious meals. Heck, sometimes my brother will even come round to do my cleaning for me as I struggle to summons the energy to scrape myself up off the sofa.  You don't deserve to be happy - You're a burden, weak and lazy, so why do you deserve the same level of happiness as those who aren't? Because you are you. You are a strong warrior, fighting the hardest battle of your life. If that isn't worthy of happiness then I don't know what is.    This is your fault - For years I believed that this was my fault. If I hadn't been drinking that Martini I wouldn't of had those panic attacks. If I hadn't of left Asda I wouldn't have wound up agoraphobic. If I'd have stood up for myself in school I wouldn't have social anxiety - the list is endless.  Sadly I do still blame my mum though, and I don't think that will ever change. A lot of mistakes were made by her that she failed to rectify. And then she passed away.   You're lazy - I've been known to sleep for 19/24 hours. While chronic fatigue will take control of my body, I will still feel guilty for sleeping through the day while others are out working hard. If they can go to bed at a decent hour and make it through the day without a nap then why can't I? Because I'm poorly, that's why. You will rest up with flu or a stomach bug so why should it be any different with depression?   While people understand the repercussions of physical illness, sadly the same can't be said for mental illness. There's that whole concept of 'it's all in your head'. Yes it may be psychological but it's both mentally and physically exhausting being at war with your own mind.   Just envisage how tired you are following a day of reading or being sat behind a computer. Your mind has been working overtime in order to process the information before your eyes. Now take that level of fatigue and add in intrusive thoughts and anxiety - your mind never gets to rest.  Things will never get better - You won't be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel because there's a big wall blocking it - depression.   You're weak - This is my mind and my body so shouldn't I be in control of it? No. People living with mental illness are the strongest of them all. There is nothing scarier than being at war with your mind. You are inclined to believe the thoughts crossing your mind because you are the one who created them but that isn't exactly true.  You're alone - Nobody cares or understands. You're the only one to have ever been through this. Your brain is wired differently. God, the list is endless. Let me tell you this, I've been there and I am still there.  When I was first diagnosed with anxiety I was beyond terrified. I instantly reverted from being a social butterfly to a nervous wreck almost overnight. I can recall sending out a Facebook SOS, asking whether anyone else had anxiety, and had taken the beta blockers that I was on at the time. I wanted success stories, but mostly a magic cure.   I am alone in my fight with depersonalisation disorder though due to it being such a rare condition. Yes I can reach out to people on support groups via message but I can't turn to those surrounding me because they can't empathise in the slightest. And explaining it to supposed professionals, well, don't get me started.   What I can say though is that, whatever you do, please use reliable sources. Wikipedia will leave you convinced that you'll wind or sectioned or a mass murderer. I will often access Mind and read related books - Claire Weakes is a good one. Oh and Susan Jeffers.  Suicidal ideation - An iffy subject. I've made no secret of the fact that I'm suicidal and that I have attempted to take my own life. I would be a pretty crappy blogger if I wasn't totally honest with my readers.   Numerous times I've reached out and said that, given half a chance, I would take my own life in a heartbeat. I'm sick of always being the strong one, and I'm sick of fighting.   If you are going through something similar please reach out and tell someone. And visit your doctor or A and E if you feel you're a danger to yourself or others.   Www.looseningthechains.co.uk"
"Hello glorious people of reddit. I have a very mysterious problem which makes no sense to me what so ever, and I really wanna know what's going on, if there is anything to explain this with. Yesterday, Feb. 5th, at right around 9:18 pm, I was in a skype call with 5 other people. I was talking to them, and we were just looking up random phobia's that didn't make much sense to us. (We weren't laughing at them we were just kinda looking for ones that were either super obscure or ones that didn't seem like you could live, like the fear of everything, or the fear of rooms.) When suddenly, 1 friend dropped out of the call stating Sudden Depression this friend had just been introduced to a new person, so we assumed that might be the cause, or at least, I did, because before I could voice my opinion, one of my friends who had met this new person before, also stated that she had the same feeling, and 5 min. later left the call as well. There were now only 3 others in the call, besides me. One of them, who worked in some kind of store that sold random stuff to put in your house, and he often had to deal with new people and was quite fine with it, but he also cited random depression seconds after the other two did, and stayed in the call, just not talking, and using typing to continue being part of the conversation before leaving as well. This also didn't seem to have specifically a impact on all people with depression, as one of the two remaining people in the call had depression, but so did everyone else who left the call (It's really a friend group full of people who aren't 100% really, I have dpd, and the other person we just added has a list of phobias that at a 10 point font it fills up 4 pages on a word doc) and that one friend stayed mildly active (Due to them playing a game) throughout the rest of the call. This honestly confused me however. Why did 3 people at the same time without communicating to each other get depression for no reason? I can't think of anything, and nothing I look for online seems to come up with anything, so, Reddit, do what you do best, please, if you've got one, give me some reasoning."
"Hey, I don't know how to begin this so here it goes. I've never been able to really describe this, so I can't google symptoms which makes me feel even more like I'm going crazy. Along with feeling worthless/etc, (like depression, but I've never been to a psychiatrist because I don't want my parents to be worried) I feel like I act very differently in new situations and around different people, like I'm not there. My eyes glaze over, I don't talk like myself. I feel like I'm a form of consciousness trapped inside a vessel; two beings seperate from each other trying to cooperate in order to appear normal, and not like a pathetic idiot to others. I'll do something stupid, and lament over it for as long as I can.   If someone could put a name to this, I'd be super relieved. Not asking for a diagnosis, btw, just a name for this (if that makes sense)."
"If I am talking to my doctor and want to be as upfront as possible to get a diagnosis and medication should I let my doctor know of my usage of the rc benzo etizolam and my weed usage or will that get me in trouble? Thanks for the responses guys, it means a lot!"
"I've been in love with this girl for the past year. We've been close friends the whole time. Recently we've started a sort of friends with benefits relationship, and for the first time in a long time I'm actually happy. Somewhat. When we're not together we're always texting but as busy people, she's not always able to text back right away. Instantly my first thought is always, what if she died. Even if she's at school or at work or told me she's doing something, I still can't get the fear out of my head. I'll initially try to push it out of my mind and take what she said she's doing at face value, but then I start second guessing and it consumes my entire thoughts. I'm fucking terrified. I've told her about it and she said she understands and appreciates my concern and that there's nothing to worry about. She tells me she'll be ok, promises to stay safe etc etc, and that works only briefly. Instantly I start considering a hundred thousand other potential scenarios where something nether of us can control happening, like a car accident or a random shooting or anything. We've had a complicated relationship so far, too complicated to detail everything here, but the gist of it is this. Every time prior to this one where we've made plans to have a relationship like this or where we confess our feelings to each other hasn't worked out. It's always ended in heartbreak and us taking a break from talking. But this time seems to be really working out, something I am not at all hard to. When I try to use reason and tell myself that nothing's happened, I chalk it up to me not being used to things working out. I feel as though I'm so scared of things falling apart again that I start coming up with any reason why they would, and then convince myself that's what happened. I constantly am worried about this, in every situation. I feel like if I let my guard down and accept the fact that she's ok and will most likely be ok, I'll be causing something bad to happen to her. I don't want to imagine life without her yet that's all I can think about. If anyone can offer any sort of advice I would really appreciate it. I don't want to live this way, constantly in fear, yet whenever I try to stop it, I start thinking, what if again. I know my worrying won't prevent any sort of unforeseen things happening but I can't stop it anyway."
"I'll begin by saying I've already been to my PCP and told her about my fears. She's been my doctor for about 5 years so knows my medical history, and I don't have any history of alzheimer's or dementia, or other memory-related mental illnesses. But she ran me through a battery of tests which were basic memory tests, and I passed and she said she saw no reason for worry, and attributed my recent memory lapses to stress, since I haven't had any blows to the head or any other symptoms like headaches or mood swings.   But I don't know if it is. I'm freaking out. Something isn't right.  I've been at my job about 3 years, and it's not overly stressful. And I just went back to school part-time to get another BA, which has added a bit of strain to my personal life since I have less time to spend with my boyfriend - but again, not really stress-inducing.   But the last month or so, I've become completely forgetful about the most mundane things.   Like this weekend my boyfriend and I were going to a Super Bowl party and I told the host I'd bring mac &amp; cheese balls. Sunday morning I went to the store to pick up ingredients. But when I got home I couldn't find the bread crumbs I know I bought - they were on the receipt. So had to rush back to the store to buy more. After I finish making them I put the can of bread crumbs in the cupboard and there is the brand new can I bought earlier. I know I looked in there and absolutely did not see it.   Or another time we had tickets to this somewhat upscale party hosted by one of my clients. Not usually our scene, but just an excuse to get dressed up and feel fancy. Before we left the apartment I remember handing the tickets to my boyfriend because they wouldn't fit in my stupid little clutch. But we got to the check-in at the party my boyfriend swears up and down I didn't hand him the tickets, and am I sure I pulled them out of my work portfolio. They let us in since we're on the list. But when I got home and checked my portfolio, there were the tickets.   And a bunch of other random stupid little things. Like forgetting to turn the clothes dryer on. Or not turning off my hair straightener (even though I used to always not only turn it off but unplug it). Or finding my house keys or work cellphone in the most random places around our apartment even though I have a little tray by the front door that I usually put them in first thing when I get home.   My boyfriend has noticed all this, and agreed with the doctor that it could be stress related. But I don't *feel* stressed, at least I didn't before I started forgetting everything. Luckily my forgetfulness hasn't seeped into my work or school life, but I'm so worried about messing up something big. I talked to my brother (who is pretty much my bestfriend) and he lovingly, in his best Kindergarten Cop impression said *it might be a tumor.* I laughed, but now I'm freaking out that it might be, and should go back to my doctor.   I don't know what I hoped to gain by posting this. I just feel so scared.     **tl/dr** - 25 yrs old, no history of alzheimer's or dementia in my family, but started forgetting the stupidiest little things. Doctor ran some memory tests, and gave me the all-clear."
"Im in the process of getting diagnosed but chose a really expensive psychiatrist by accident. My initial appointment cost $400. She is out of network. I am supposed to take the computer test today and that alone costs almost $200. The appointment to discuss results will also be $200.  I realize i made a mistake and am thinking about just getting officially diagnosed ADHD.  My question is, can i take this diagnosis to any in-network doctor or psychiatrist without having to get rediagnosed for ADHD with each new doctor? It is a time consuming and expensive process. Id like to cut my losses now if this is the case."
"I am not living.  I am a teenager currently doing A-Levels in the UK, patiently waiting for adulthood to wreak havoc on my brittle mind and body. I have applied for multiple universities already; a forced, uninspiring task. Before I begin, I would like to stress that I am aware my life, though unprivileged in the community I am in, will be a dream for someone else and I simply wish to use this platform as a component of relief.  I suffer from severe depression and there are a few things I would like to address. In my college, I know that the teachers value me less as a human being due to my grades. They fluctuate, you see. Some weeks I am consumed by suicidal tendencies, whereas others I am ready to learn. Recently more than usual, however, I have noticed their enhanced disgust and pity. I am surrounded by Russell Group applicants, but as a result of my predicted grades, I was assured no notable university would want me. Because of this, it appears those around me have accepted me as if I am a devolved version of themselves, a useless body contributing nothing meaningful to society. I know this sounds obscure, but I promise you this is the way I, and many others, feel. I am treated like a moronic cave dweller. What makes it worse is I believe I have a solid, rational view of the world so when adults look down at me as if I am an ant, I am angered and emit an emotionless and careless attitude.   It's very to use the term 'depression' lightly and nonchalantly, it's stigmatised and overlooked. At so many moments I have just wanted to scream: Apologies for failing, last night I had pills in hand ready to poison my worthless body, the topic of history wasn't particularly at the forefront of my mind. And of course, I can completely fathom that I do not deserve special treatment, but at least a little more understanding since 1 in 4 people in the UK are experiencing the same feeling as if one is deteriorating, the same acceptance of defeat and fatigue. Along with depression, I feel as if depersonalisation is a problem for me as well. Sometimes I feel actions have no consequence because I don't exist or as if I am in a bubble where sounds whir and soften as my sight blurs. Any connection I have with an object, environment or person dissipates and I'm alone. I feel as if I am a just a brain within a skull, floating and trapped with my own deteriorating thoughts.  What I have noticed in addition is that politicians are usually well or privately educated and whilst being a high achiever with depression exists, it's not as common. Therefore the likelihood of coming across an influential figure with a mental health issue is low, meaning, once again, mental health in government is forgotten and camouflaged and in turn, ignored. Not only this, for some reason other students find the concept of depression relatable and humorous. Though I do not know what is occurring in their personal lives, I am still slightly irritated when a successful, emotionally healthy student attempts to connect with me by lying (perhaps I am jealous). I, of course, don't enjoy having a dismal outlook on life and I desperately want to improve.   I am not living, I feel utterly decomposed."
"Hey, hopefully someome in this community might have some experience with this.  I am posting using a throwaway, because I'm paranoid, go figure!  I am 26 years old now.  As I get older, it seems I'm growing more paranoid, at least, I think that's what's happening.   Some examples of recent things that I have done or thought:  1) I have accused my fiance of cheating at least 10 times in the last year, but when I strain my memory I can't come up with a single peice of evidence, not even circumstantial. She is, of course, getting fed up with me.  2) My heart races and I get nervous when I get a phone call, not because I'm nervous to talk on the phone, but because I wonder if it is the police or FBI calling to accuse me of a crime, even though I know I've haven't done anything.   3) When I get mail from, say, my cable provider, I think they will accuse me of hacking or something I don't even know how to do. Of course it's always just a bill.  4) Everytime I come into work and check my emails my heart races thinking I'll be fired for negligence even though I've never neglected my duties.  5) Like a lot of people I've indulged in conspiracy theories, but as I look back now at what I'm starting to take seriously, I realize it is bordering on delusion.  For example the idea that there is an underground satan worshiping cult in the government.  I was going to ask if this is normal but after typing it all out I realize it's definitely not."
"Hi,   So recently I've been having thought loops which consist of gibberish sentences. Words which don't make any sense looping in my head. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about this? I've tried to Google it but haven't been able to get much info."
I feel like my mental problem stems from my head concussion when I was young.
"so this girl is crazy, we got into an argument and it went physically she slapped me in the face, and i uppercut her jaw, and she suddenly laughed and she pinned me to the floor,as she was sitting on my stomach, she punctured me with her fingernails, i have to get locked in with her and im afraid shes going to do the same thing, do i deserve this?"

One minute, I feel so low, like **I'm trapped**, and all I want to do is **disappear**.  &gt;Then suddenly, I feel the complete **opposite**, and I'm really happy and I start thinking about everything in a really positive light."
"Male ,18, third world dweller.  I've been having this episodes since I was in eight grade, I think, when I'm alone I'm at peace, but when I start to socialize with my environment and suddenly I owe favors to people, like taking a chair apart for them to sit, I get very anxious. It's very strange, sometimes I think that I don't have friends (to clarify, they are all nice and not abusive) the thing is: sometimes I don't have any empathy for the people I should care about ( like my parents and family) and I don't know if it's because of the bullying that I have become like this or the cause of all this is my depression."

"Hi so I'm 19 years old and female. I've had a history of depression and anxiety and take anti-depressants (Effexor).   Today I moved back into my parents house from my SO's apartment. We are still together but decided it's best for me to move out since our relationship was becoming toxic. But don't get me wrong we were never abusive to one another. Or at least I know he wasn't. I worry that I can be seen as an abuser since I became so emotionally dependent on him. I have been unemployed for awhile so we were spending excessive time together and the past couple of weeks have been upsetting. we don't want to hate each other. Of course not. That's why we did this. We plan on getting a place with a couple of friends whenever we have the money this summer.   Anyway I've been upset all day. I haven't eaten since yesterday when we decided I should leave. Even though we both are excited for our relationship to grow, I feel sick to my stomach. This is exactly why I had to leave. My emotional dependency is overwhelming.  I've been letting him be alone all day. I only messaged him to ask if we could FaceTime before I went to sleep so I can see my kitties. Now I'm just waiting for him to be able to.  I don't have anyone to talk to.   I have my SO and my best friend. My best friend is currently comforting another best friend of hers and can't really come get me or anything. I texted another friend of mine but she seems so disinterested despite our constant support for one another. Now I'm laying in bed.   I feel disgusted by myself. I won't hurt myself or anything but I'm sure I'll drive myself up the wall tonight. I'm sure I might get desperate and ask my best friend to pick me up later if she has the energy. I just feel awful.  My mental health is so bad not just right now but lately. I'm worried my antidepressants stopped working and I'm worried I'm going to lose my SO. Even though I know he loves me. I just didn't want to move back in with my parents. I see why we are doing it but it's easier for him since he gets to stay there in the home we had.   I ask if I should go to the hospital because I don't feel capable of coping at the moment. I need help and I know my SO wants me to get help. He had been hospitalized years ago for suicidal thoughts and told me that it's not a bad thing to get help.   I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense I am thinking about so many things at once right now."
"I recently went through a breakup, as the title suggests. We'd been together for two years; she cheated on me. In the end she said the last month she only stayed with me to keep me from hurting myself, and after thinking a little I realized she'd been lying about things for months.  This was the girl I lost my virginity to, and I thought we lost it together but that turned out to be a lie. I've always had a love-hate relationship with my own sexuality, but I was comfortable with her.  Now, when I do anything sexual I just feel distracted, I often think of her, and it's pretty much always self-destructive in nature. I suddenly have no confidence with girls. I will talk to a girl for a few days and then completely pull away. The thought of being with a girl sexually makes me feel inadequate and self-conscious, like I won't be enough. It's only made worse knowing my ex is already with someone else. This is odd to me, because it's been a few months now, and I had made some progress.  I really just want to overcome these things. I want to meet someone else and have a fulfilling relationship. I want to stop being so self-destructive and wishy-washy. I want to meet people, because at the moment I don't have a ton of friends. But it all has to start somewhere and I think these odd doubts and whatnot are a good place to start.  I appreciate any kind of help, advice, diagnosis, encouragement, etc. that anyone can give. If this is posted in the wrong place, please direct me to the right place and I will remove it.  Thank you so much!"
"So, run outs for fraternities happened this weekend and we started pledging this weekend. I've been struggling slightly in classes because of the content and way it's presented to me, but I communicate well with the professors and class mates for assistance. I talk to friends often, have a great girlfriend, and am really excited about pledging, but I just feel empty; like no matter how much good that's happening it's still doesn't feel enough. If anyone has any thoughts or if anyone feels a similar way I'd really appreciate some advice. Thank you."
I've been severely depressed for years. I cry all the time for reasons I don't even know. I feel so much but I've just bottled it up inside and I think it's starting to break me.   Sometimes I have bouts of happiness where I feel amazing. Like nothing can go wrong and then something will trigger me and I start to get depressed again.  It's like I have 2 voices in my head one saying I'm worthless and the other saying I'm strong and I can be happy. But the worthless voice can take over.   I overthink things all the time and start to beat my self up for the smallest things. It scares me sometimes. I have thoughts of death and losing my family.   I care deeply about people and I have this feeling that no one gives a fuck about me.
"I have two children (1.5 y/o boy, 5 y/o girl) and I am pregnant with my 3rd. I live with my boyfriend (D). I suffer from depression, anxiety and, PTSD.  I have no one within 100 miles that I am close to except my SO and children.My daughter is from a previous relationship. Her father was emotionally and physically abusive. I ran away when I was pregnant. I go through severe bouts of depression that causes D to put his life on hold to take care of me. I can see the affect it has on him. He is smoking more, getting frustrated more easily, falling behind in work and school.  Lately I have been thinking about leaving after this baby is born. The more I think about it the more I realize D and my son would be better off without me. The only reason I would bring my daughter is because D has no rights to her, I am terrified her dad may find her and she is 5 and me leaving her would destroy her. My son is almost 18 months (1.5) and I love and adore him but if I were to leave now he wouldn't remember me. D has a large supportive family. Our son would be better off with D and his family than with a mother who can barely function. I know I tell D he will just convince me to stay but I really feel this is what's best for them.  Am I a horrible mother for even considering this?"
